"   A new level of awful. My curiosity got the better of me. Could Delta be as bad as everyone I knew told me it was. I should have trusted my instinct. A clapped out old A330, clapped out cabin design, the seat to be fair was comfortable and I did get a good sleep. Dinner service did not happen as they did not have enough beef to cater for the needs of their business passengers. Sat in seat 4J I was surprised to learn that you need to sit on the ""captains side"" of the plane if you want to get your choice of meal with Delta. The crew member I spoke to was wholly disinterested in any form of complaint and said ""Listen what do you want?"" Naturally I considered approaching the purser on the plane to speak to him about perhaps guiding his staff on how to deal with premium passengers. When I learned a few moments later that this guy was the purser I realised that my night was over and this was a bus service to Atlanta and that I should expect no level of service whatsoever. Looking for good things. The seat, thats it. Bring your own food, don't expect any manners, get on the bus, sit down, shut up and you'll get to your destination in one piece. I spend a lot of my own money flying in a style that I like to enjoy. Delta failed, failed and failed again. I regret that I now have to continue flying on to Paris with Delta. Thankfully this flight is in economy and as such I already have no expectation of service whatsoever."
"   After a 24-hour journey home to Toronto from South Africa, the last leg of my trip was on American Airlines out of Chicago. As I settled into my seat, I watched my luggage being loaded on the plane parked next to me. I alerted the flight attendant, who quickly reached out to the supervisor to intervene. After much discussion and delay, I finally saw the baggage handlers walk my suitcase over to the stairs of our gangway. Eureka! I saved myself the extra hassle of recovering my luggage after Qatar so skillfully and autonomously managed several potential baggage issues on the other legs of my trip, or so you would think. Even though I was able to intervene enough to get my suitcase to the door of the plane, it actually never made it inside. Whatever happened at that moment saw my luggage delayed until the next flight, 2 hours later. Not impressed by the 'we-don't-really-care-about-you-or-your-luggage' attitude. Oh yeah, and here's a little bag a mini-pretzels to make up for it. They could learn a lot from international standards."
"   After a bad flight experience with American Airlines 3 years ago, I was pretty hesitant to fly with American again but it was the best option for my needs and I believe in second chances. I arrived in Washington DC at IAD 2 hours before my 7.20 am flight to find that it had been delayed to 10.30 am and my connecting flight in Dallas had subsequently been changed to accommodate for the delay. Even though I asked two employees, nobody could give a definitive answer as to why the flight was delayed 3 hours. I realize that these things happen and my connection had been altered so I wasn't too upset with the changes, but once it was time to board the now 10.30 am flight things started to de-escalate. They boarded some passengers and then stopped and made everyone get off the plane because, our pilot was missing! There was a major miscommunication about where the pilot was and the flight staff didn't have much information to tell us at first. We later found out that he was at least an hour away at another airport in DC. Knowing that I only had a 1 hour layover between my newly rebooked flights, I was panicking. We were finally allowed to re board our flight after many miscommunications about the pilots whereabouts and the flight attendants seemed to find the entire situation comical or maybe they were trying to lighten the mood for their unpleased passengers? The only saving grace in this story is the employee at the gate counter. Without her help I would have certainly missed my connection, but because of her tremendous efforts I was able to make my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Of course, the trip home wasn't quite as terrible, but again I only had one hour to catch my connection and the flight leaving Oklahoma City was 30 minutes late and again I made my connection by 5 minutes. The flights themselves weren't worse or better than average and there are some very helpful employees, but I'm going to steer clear from American Airlines from now on."
"   Akron to Norfolk via Philadelphia. Unfortunately had to cancel a flight. Went to cancel and request a credit for future travel and was told that on a $500 flight, the cancellation fee would be $200 per ticket or $400 for this flight! 75% of the cost! Most absurd thing I ever heard. Southwest does not do this. Will never give American Airlines another chance. Also purchased, what I thought was their trip cancellation insurance at the time of booking on their site only to find out this is a separate company and basically this coverage only covers specific situations. What a ripoff."
"   All perfect, flew American Airlines for work on a Tuesday to San Francisco, then to Los Angeles and then back to NYC. All flights on time. Check in at the airport was very easy all 3 times. Boarding by new group system, very organized. On board the A321 you get a personal IFE, lots of movies, all for free. No food provided, just for purchase. Drinks offered up to 3 times during a 6hr flight. FA very nice. Cabin feels very comfortable for economy. Bags fast on belt after arrival."
"   Always switching gates, sometimes even terminals. Arrived at gate as stated on ticket at boarding time and sat down to wait. Then I heard them say flight to Tuscan had changed gates. My flight was to Portland, which had obviously been changed earlier. After slow, seemingly uninterested service I was told my flight had moved 20 gates to the other end of terminal. I ran and literally arrived 2 min after door closed. Lady made no real effort to get me on the plane. Just cited the rules. Meanwhile I could see plane sitting there. Clearly could have helped if she tried. Service on flights and at gates always seems plastic and fake, like they are just going thru motions and not even trying to hide it. No regard for the customer. I will never fly American Airlines again!"
"   American Airlines cancelled our flight from Dublin to Chicago (not due to weather), but no call despite the fact that I had given them our cell number. They rerouted us to London, Chicago, but failed to mention it would take an extra day to get home. When I noticed this, I had to talk with a different agent in London to route us through Dallas. We ended up 5+ hours late and missed connecting flight, having to stay overnight in Seattle and buying new tickets for $350. AA refused to pay for hotel, meals, rebooked flight despite that they got us to our destination a day later. Will try to avoid them as much as possible in the future. "
"   American Airlines couldn’t find the pilot for the flight 5010 from Philadelphia to Manchester NH, the gate agent said that we were almost ready to board a couple times. Then she announced that they needed to locate the captain and had been calling him. The woman next to me said that she didn’t want to go on the flight if they did find that captain. Who doesn’t call in when they will miss a flight (what could he have been doing?)  Then, the gate agent announced that they had found another pilot. This pilot #2 was a passenger on another plane but agreed to fly this plane. We were delayed but did get to Manchester. At least the gate agent was honest enough to say what was going on. I was supposed to fly into Portland, ME but that flight was abruptly cancelled. And my friends were nice enough to pick me up in New Hampshire, for which I am thankful, or the vacation would have been cancelled."
"   American Airlines flight from Milwaukee to Chicago was showing as delayed by 35 minutes upon our arrival to airport. No problem as we had 1 x 2.5 hour layover for a connecting flight. However, time went on and the departure time kept getting extended for no reason given. We were instructed that the flight would still occur. When the flight showed a departure time of 9.51 (almost 2 hours past its original time - and keep in mind the flight is only a 45 minute flight from Milwaukee to Chicago), I went up to find out what was going on. Fortunately a pilot was there and told me that the 1st plane had mechanical issues and then another was sent for and it returned for mechanical issues and that they were looking for another plane. They were talking about getting a bus to send passengers to Chicago. Unfortunately, that would no longer be an option as it would take at least 2 hours to drive, park and get to gate - which means we would be missing our connecting flight. Why didn't someone make that decision sooner - or at least let us know as I could have driven to Chicago or got my own transportation. No communication. When a gate agent finally arrived, she said she could change our flight to get us to our destination, but it was not leaving until 4 pm (we had been at the airport since 6.20 am). So now we had to wait until 4 pm to leave and it was 10 am at that point. We were later given some food vouchers by a ticketing agent as the gate agent seemed to think that this was normal for AA and she agreed with us but there was nothing she could do. When we tried to use the vouchers - which states only good for food and beverages - at Nonna's restaurant, they refused to honor part of it as we had two drinks with our food and they stated that it did not include alcoholic beverages - which it does not state on the voucher anywhere. Again, more issues. We finally arrived at our destination over 7 hours late (which is big in a short 4 day vacation). The experience was terrible all around. So much so that we are looking at cancelling our Citi Advantage card and never flying AA again."
"   American Airlines is using a very old plane for this route from Miami to Milan. There are no individual screens for in-flight entertainment which is very unusual for such a long flight. Also the dinner and breakfast served is of poor quality but in line what you pay for flying with American Airlines. However, the flight was on-time and the flight attendants were friendly."
"   American Airlines overbooked the flight from St George to Phoenix by 1 passenger. I checked in 35 minutes before the deadline of 30 minutes. I was at the gate before the 15 minute deadline to get my seat assignment since they overbooked. They said that the plane was full and since I was the last one to check in, that they could book me on the next flight which was 5 hours later. I said that if they knew that the flight was overbooked, why didn't they ask for volunteers, I had to go to work. They were very arrogant, and gave me a hard time, in fact I had to beg them to give me another ticket on the next flight. I sent a complaint into American Airlines and all they said was ""sorry, hope your next experience will be better"". No compensation, just excuses. I sent in verification of my arrival on time, but they just ignored it. This is the worst customer service I have had with an airline. In addition, the security told the gate people I was coming since I was handicapped, so they knew in advance but managed to board the plane early and since it was full I was out of luck. This is the most unprofessional airline."
"   American keeps getting progressively worse with each trip of mine! After the horror ripped baggage and damaged articles experience the previous trip I regret giving American Airlines another chance. After 2-3 months of explaining and convincing I finally was offered some compensation. The only reason I decided to take America again because of the $100 gift card they offered. Last week, I relocated completely from NY to TX. I literally moved my entire house from one coast to the other, and without any consideration to that AA charged me $100 for 3 pounds extra. Yes you heard it right, $100 for 3 pounds! The guy at the counter apparently had no power to let ""3 pounds"" in a check in bag go or make any exceptions and I contact customer care to take care of this later on, but all I get is a couple of copy-pasted auto replies from customer service and then they disappear completely. Maybe AA uses the strategy of ""let the customer lose patience waiting for our reply"". That way the case dies a natural death! No consideration to customer satisfaction whatsoever."
   Amsterdam to Boston. Not surprised by poor service of a major US airline. Seats changed at the last minute. Given worst seats in business. Chief flight attendant did not care. Luckily traveling on KLM ticket from South Africa. KLM crew intervened and got our seats changed. Special meals were not on board despite being present on Delta web site. Typical US airline cattle car service despite being in business class. Seats had privacy only one per window once we got our seats changed. Excellent food and comfort once we took off and had issues resolved. Bonus miles for problems on return from customer service were too little too late.
"   Amsterdam to Portland. Last year at this time we flew Heathrow to Seattle and Seattle to Portland and it was a wonderful experience especially on the way back because at Portland I was asked to checkin my hand luggage and garment bag. The garment bag didn't make it but after a Delta supervisor made a number of calls the bag was on the next flight and our pilot said on arrival at Heathrow he would let us know if the bag made it. To my amazement after a long flight leaving an hour late but arriving on time he told me at the exit that my bag was indeed on board. What fantastic service. I sent email to Delta but never even got an acknowledgement of it. This year from Amsterdam direct to Portland on DL179 we were called back to the gate because of a security issue. Bags on board but not the passengers who owned them? Not Delta's fault. But on a 10 hour + flight you would expect not to have to be reaching for Jerseys, hoodies & gloves to keep warm. Lots of passengers complained about it being freezing for the whole flight (it was colder than the cold water served up). We are flying back on the 22nd and hope we can get some sleep from Portland to San Francisco to Amsterdam then to Manchester, please Delta don't have it so cold."
"   Amsterdam to Seattle. I have to admit having read the reports on this site I wasn't looking forward to this flight but the service was very good, the flight attendants professional and helpful and food/drinks offered were good quality and well presented. Seat was comfortable. If I have a complaint the IFE film selection was not particularly my choice but there was enough I could pick from for the flight."
"   An early morning start at Dulles, check in was very smooth and boarding was orderly, the aircraft was old but the service was very good arrival at Atlanta was on time. Delta attendants at arrival were very helpful and courteous, our connection at Atlanta was distant, we had to go from terminal C all the way to terminal F and our flight to Honolulu was on time. We boarded an older A330-300, from it's registration number it was one of the old Northwest Airlines aircraft, but the layout of the Business First is the latest Delta product. Delta have an excellent record of their upkeep of their aircraft even if they are very old. The entertainment system worked well but the food was very poor. Again the service was professional and top notch. Arrival in Honolulu was ahead of time and we had a great view of the Big Island and Maui and towards landing we saw beautiful Waikiki."
"   Appalling experience from Milan to New York and back. I was unable to print my boarding pass from the website despite being checked in. I was berated at the check-in desk for being late and asked several times why. I was not late and had to wait for the gate to open once I got there using no express line. The flight attendants on the way to New York were nice, but the airplane was just something out of the 90s. No private screen (which is standard for British, United, Lufthansa, Swiss), no way to control the air conditioning (it was freezing cold), the audio from the audio jack was not working well and the seat pocket was a little broken. On the way back, the cabin crew, and particularly one flight attendant, was just so rude I could not believe my ears. I was asked if I wanted to change seats because I was seated close to the restrooms in the back and when I politely declined explaining that I wasn’t feeling very well and wanted to stay close to the restroom I got a ""yeah, whatever!"" as a response while she walked away. And during landing she said to her colleague, thinking we wouldn’t hear I hope, ""I mean, we are landing, wake up people!"". The food was not bad, but was the same for both long haul flights. I will avoid ever flying with American Airlines if I can."
"   Atlanta to Augusta. Once again Delta disappoints in their ability to deliver anything close to the promised service. I know complaining about small planes is played out but in this case I went out of my way to purchase specific luggage that meets all airline requirements and of course none of the provided storage space was as advertised. And to top it off the flight was delayed, again. Honestly would travel any other airline if possible. This has to be one of the shorter flights in the country and still service is poor."
"   Atlanta to Charleston. Most of the trip was just fine other than one terrible person at the gate. She was rude and downright inappropriate towards me and my family. I have never been treated so poorly by a supervisor! This woman needs extensive customer service training and because of her alone I am unlikely to fly Delta again. Other than that woman, the food, seats and basically everything provided by Delta was poor, but that is to be expected in economy class. The rest of the ground and flight crew were mostly cordial. My flight did land on time, and I have no other complaints"
"   Atlanta to Charlotte. Let me preface by saying this is not against Delta as a whole. It's for the gate agent. The lady working the gate in Atlanta at B29 on 2/23 for the flight to Charlotte at 3:10pm needs some serious lessons in customer service. I understand they have policies and protocols but there's really no need to be blatantly rude to your customers about it. I fly almost weekly with a carry on (that I'm almost always forced to check at the gate), my computer bag and a small purse. The purse can fit inside the computer bag but I wear it as a cross body and just slide it in the computer bag when I get to my seat. As I am walking into the tarmac she makes me stop and consolidate my tiny purse into my laptop bag. After a quick argument saying that it'll fit, I fly with this all the time she forces me to step aside, so I did and then I backed up to be out of the way and she proceeds to yell at me for where I choose to stand and then essentially makes fun of me to the next passenger boarding saying that I clearly didn't understand her the first ten times she said it. For the record, I heard her and I know the rules. I fly enough with the same 3 items and I'm never given a hard time about it. So if she enforces her rules more than others, bravo to a job well done but at least do it with some finesse and class. She's just rude and unprofessional. This is Delta, not a low class airline. The best part was, after I consolidated, they forced me to check my carry on anyways. She could have suggested that from the getgo instead of making a spectacle of me. The 1 out of 10 stars is for her, not Delta."
"   Atlanta to Cleveland. Delta treated me great when I needed to return home 2 days earlier due to husband illness, they made it very simple and even though I had not purchased insurance they only had be pay a 50Dollar fee. Also no problems with boarding the flight, everyone was great."
"   Atlanta to Dallas Ft Worth. What has happened to American Airlines, as cocky CEO declares ""we will never lose money again"".  At the same time, as a long time customer, service, Advantage profram, dependability and overall satisfaction for me has gone from 90+ to less than 25%.  Solid F, Three of last four, 9 of last 13 flights have been delayed. Statistics tell us thats not bad luck, simply bad maintenance. FF miles are worthless. Customer is at fault and needs to pay a fee at every opportunity. Again, solid F for me."
   Atlanta to Detroit via Charlotte. My flight was delayed in Atlanta and started at 7:30pm and my connection was missed in Charlotte at 8pm. When I requested customer service they allocated me for 10:30pm flight and the last minute they said pilot was unavailable so flight delayed to 2am. At 1:30am aa representative came told that flight was cancelled.. and they are very rude and helpful when I asked for the reason. And next day they have asked me to come to airport by 8 so that they can allocate me on 9:30AM flight. When I came to airport they said flight was full they can't accommodate.. they said they will allocate me 12:30 pm flight it was also delayed till 3pm because of unavailability of pilots. And they were unable to allocate a seat in that flight also.. when I asked for the reason they said your name was not showed up and their behavior is very rude. This is my second time travel in American Airlines and two times faced the same issue. These people don't understand the situation. This might be my last travel in American Airlines and I won't recommend this airline to anyone.
"   Atlanta to Ft Myers. They overbooked the flight to include my ticket, leaving me stranded at Hartsfield since it was the last flight out back to RSW, and said that I would have to find another flight. Waited at the gate kiosk for 15 minutes only to have them rudely direct me to a delta customer service counter. There, I had to wait for almost an hour and once I talked to the lady she said that since I was an economy customer she could not rebook me for another flight since I had a zero balance available. It was their fault they overbooked and they refused to give service. They said I could try calling the customer service number to order another full price ticket (for $458). Found a way better deal with Southwest for $230 that left at a better time."
"   Atlanta to Grand Cayman Island. I had flown 16 hours and had gone more than 2 days without sleep before getting on this last leg. Onboard I requested the flight attendant for warm water and she asked if I were alright and when I told her what I was going through she gave me a glass of ginger ale which worked instantly. What I love about Delta is just how cheerful their cabin staff were, going out of their way to make passengers happy."
"   Atlanta to Miami. Arrived 3 hours early for connecting flight after our KLM flight from Amsterdam. Due to huge line in immigration and security and hardly any staff raced to gate to board for Miami but they closed the doors already. No accommodations, no apology just rude attitude from gate agent. No calling passengers names and flight left missing many passengers from the wait line. Have no idea if luggage made it or not and freezing cold lying on floor amongst all the dust and construction noise. Very unpleasant situation. The KLM flight was little late departing as waiting for late passenger to board and announcing them several times. No such courtesy for us and no courtesy or help at all. "
"   Atlanta to Miami. I sit here at gate D25, waiting to board a flight I shouldn’t be on, more frustrated than I’ve ever been with an airline. I’ve had one bad experience after another with American Airlines. I arrive to gate T9 around 5am and immediately go to the check in desk because I’m flying Basic Economy for the first time so I want the gate agents to know that I’m here and would like a seat number for the flight. One rudely responds, “We’ll call your name when we’re ready for that.” I sit down patiently waiting for my name. Finally my name is called, and she asks me if my small duffel bag is the only bag I have? I respond that yes it is. Another agent chimes in that it looks like it it is too big and that I will have to pay for it. I respond that it should fit under my seat, so I put it in the demonstration bin and of course it fits. They tell me they just wanted to see my bags and that I can sit back down and wait for the next instruction. When it comes time for boarding group 9 to board, I wait for my name to be called. (now apparently there are two individuals with my last name, and the other individual is flying standby. But I don’t find this out until later.) they ask the group to walk with them down the runway and wait for a seat number. I ask the agent when I can board since I paid for a ticket, she asks the other agent about me who checks her list and says that “You’re not on my list!” They give up all seats on the flight and I have now missed my flight. We get back to the desk at which point I’ve never had two grown women be so disrespectful to me. They both blamed me for not getting on the flight. Saying the flight had two Individuals with my last name but not once did they call a first name. I now know that neither Individual with my last name made the flight. I need to be compensated for my inconvenience and these two ladies need to be suspended for how rude they were to myself and other passengers I witnessed. They both should be mandated to take customer service training."
"   Atlanta to Miami. My husband and I purchased plane tickets for our honeymoon roughly 7 months ago for this flight. We were just married two weeks ago and we have plans to spend a week in the East Caribbean. We purchased economy tickets with Delta Airlines because, as one would expect, we were on a close budget while saving for the wedding. We followed up with check in procedure, signing in to schedule our seating at 4:33pm, 24 hours before our flight. The check in opened at 4:30pm on May 18th. 3 minutes into check in all of the seats were booked. So on our honeymoon we are having to sit separately. My husband then called Delta Airlines and spoke to a representative that stated it was a full flight, and for us to speak to the front desk representative at our terminal for accommodations. We arrive at the airport today and waited in line. After hearing an announcement stating that there are several unassigned seats currently and not to worry, that a seat assignment would be given to the individuals when they board the plane. When we did our check in yesterday we had a choice of 2 separate individual seats rows apart from each other even though we booked our tickets 7 whole months in advance. The representative greeted us when we came up to the desk and let us know that no accommodations would be made for our situation even though it was a special occasion for us. She brushed us off and asked us to please take a seat. I am dissappointed. We recently flew with Delta earlier this year and I was highly impressed with their level of organization and professionalism. We travelled with our family of 14 people and were able to book 3 full rows of seats for our whole family with no issues. I am sad on the first day of our trip that no accommodations could have been made for my new husband and I when we followed procedure and planned so meticulously. We are boarding the plane now. "
"   Atlanta to Orlando. We had a fantastic experience with Delta. My husband and I flew for the first time ever to get to our honeymoon cruise out of Orlando. Delta made the entire experience so easy and stress-free. They made sure we knew exactly where to go every step of the way, and we got to our gate plenty early. The flight attendants were kind and very helpful. We got to enjoy a snack and a drink on our flights to Orlando and back home. And the TV screens with games and movies made our flight home even more enjoyable. We are so grateful to Delta for making our first flying experience absolutely perfect, and we look forward to flying with them in the future."
"   Atlanta to Philadelphia. No more American Airlines, 3 hours delay and they treat passages terribly. I missed my to be at my god daughter's mass today and almost missed a chance to get on the 2nd standby flight. Customer service is worst. They don't even look at my face as talking to me or barely want to talk to me. What kind of business is this? "
"   Atlanta to Philadelphia. They told us they had a problem in the system, so we would have to wait a little - which I didn't have a problem with. Then they went on and on and kept on delaying the expected departure time. And after 2 whole hours of sitting on the plane, they told us we would have to go outside in the boarding area and wait. At this point I was a little annoyed, but not mad. After that, they made us wait 3 more hours outside in the boarding area, with little to no help from the staff on when we were going to leave, before they told us the whole flight had been cancelled. I was going to miss a whole day of seminars that I had to attend. Then I was like its okay, mistakes happen, and then rebooked the flight for the next morning at 6AM since they had no more available flights on that day.  I got back home at around 2, so I had been there for about 8 hours.  The next day I was on my way to the airport when I got a text message that my 6AM flight had been cancelled too. At this point I was furious. It was not even a weather related issue, it was because of American Airline's lack of preperation ahead of a flight, in which they always seem to have problems with their system. I had to call their customer service an try to rebook, since I had to get to Philly as soon as I could. The staff on the phone were horrible, first they said there were no more flights availble on that day to philly, (In which there were because I could literally see that there were available flights - I was looking at it on my phone when I was talking to them). Then I asked them if they could switch me to another airline, in which they said that it was not possible. I hung up the call out of frustration, and called them back a few minutes later, this time someone else picked up. I asked him the same question I asked the other guy, that if they could switch me to another airline. This time, the answer was different. He said he could switch me over to united. I was shocked, because the other guy told me they could not do that. The united flight was later in that day, so by then the program I was going to attend in Philly would be over, so I decided to ask for a refund. I had to scream at the guy to let me get a refund because he was refusing to give it to me for ""privacy"" purposes, which didn't make sense at all. Even after all that I went through, I could not understand how someone could not give someone their money back. After about an hour of yelling and convincing, he finally gave me a refund.  I do not recommend this airline to anyone, there are better options out there and I think you would save yourselves a lot of time and money by avoiding American Airlines."
"   Atlanta to Portland with Delta. We had infant in arms. They split us up and weren't able to sit us together. We had to beg people near us to trade seats because no one wanted to sit in the middle. It was night flight and the kid was cranky. When we landed the new stroller was scratched up, dirty, and not taken care off. Couple years ago Delta had delayed flight and didn't provide us hotel since the flight was in 8 hours. We thought something changed since those couple years, but guess not. "
"   Atlanta to San Salvador with Delta (Flight 729). The flight was onboard the newly retrofitted B757-200. The aircraft cabin was amazing. The seats were all new and clean, the mood lighting the overhead bins made the cabin look much more open and inviting. The flight crew was very helpful. All the flight attendants spoke Spanish and they assisted elderly and young passengers. The flight departed a couple minutes prior to scheduled and the captain kept everyone informed about the flight. Once airborne the flight attendants served us a sandwich, pretzels, cookies, and a snack size snickers with a beverage. This was good since the flight was a short international flight. Onboard every passenger also had access to inflight entertainment. The seats where more comfortable compared to the older B757s. Overall the Delta Air Lines experience has upgraded and was exceptional.
"
"   Atlanta to Santiago de Chile. Quite an awful experience on a decrepit Boeing 767-300. Cabin configuration with a staggered 1-2-1, seat itself very old but sort of ok (narrow though). The worst of this flight is the inflight service, seems at Delta they don't take their premium customers seriously; food below par (entree cold, beef fillet hard as a stone); presentation so poor (when you put some warm bread on my tray, why on Earth should you put it on the butter so that it melts everywhere?). Cabin crew attitude too casual for a business class cabin. IFE in such a small screen that some smartphones are bigger; new business class blanket (by Westin) is oddly covered - on the supposedly external face in a very hard and ""plastic""-look-and-touch material which I fail to understand. Overall the service looks more like a Premium Economy than a Business Class, I keep asking myself when Delta will get rid of those old dinosaurs that are B767s"
"   Atlanta to St. Thomas via Miami. Terrible. Flight delayed from Miami thus we missed our ferry from St. Thomas to Tortola. Staff at desk were not only useless but nasty as well. Would not give us details or assistance beyond telling us the St. Thomas staff will help. We get there, the staff is even worse. Now on the return leg of our trip same story. Flight is delayed thus we're missing our connection. No help, apologies or anything besides ""you're stuck. Will never fly them again. If I could give a zero rating I would."
"   Auckland to Boston via Los Angeles. There are two options to get from direct from NZ to the US, United or American (Air NZ & QANTAS flights are operated by those airlines too). American were slightly cheaper so I picked them and I was very pleasantly surprised. Check in was a breeze, and the crew were well presented and welcoming. Throughout the flight they were polite, friendly and attentive. Best of all they had personality and  chatted happily with passengers. The food was nice and just the right amount to be full but not bloated. Inflight entertainment selection was really good. Leg room and seat width were fine for me (average height and build). Just take your own headphones as they only give out ear buds. So overall the Auckland to LA flight was excellent value for money and I'd fly American again to get to the US. I had concerns about my short layover in LA, only 2 hours to clear customs and security and get to the Boston flight. I needn't have worried, LAX do it right. They had an Express Connection pass waiting for all passengers connecting within 2 hours which meant I skipped a lot of queues. They had staff at multiple points to direct passengers, so I made it to my next flight an hour after getting off the first one, and had time to grab a coffee. LA to Boston flight was well organised, left on time, the crew were fine and I'd happily do this flight again too. Again, bring your own headphones. The inflight entertainment was available, but they don't give out headphones. Overall I was nicely surprised by American and will use them next time I head to America."
"   Auckland to Los Angeles. Horrible Experience. Rude flight attendants, cramped space and very uncomfortable seats. We had more leg room in our much shorter connecting flight from LA to Seattle with Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Auckland to LA was a pitiful excuse for an international flight. I would rather fly 14 hours with Qantas via their connections rather than sit through 12 hour with American Airlines. My husband and I swore off American Airlines before our plane even left the ground. I can't believe this airline is still in business."
"   Augusta to Albuquerque via Charlotte. American Airlines flies most Eastern US Flights through a Charlotte Hub. Their timing in Charlotte does not account for the ""chain of comedy"" error that are built into domestic flights governed by the TSA. In a recent round trip from Augusta GA to Albuquerque NM; the return was routed from Albuquerque to Phoenix to Chicago to Charlotte to Augusta. The lay-over in CLT was scheduled as 56 minutes. The flight in Chicago did not board until 25 minutes after scheduled. The pilot taxied to a runway, waited 10 minutes and announced windspeed was too high to take off, waited another 15 minutes, then taxied to another runway where he announced the wind speed was fine, we were 5th in line for take off. Arrived in CLT and deboarded at 10:12 PM at terminal B16, connecting flight doors close at E24, 10:20 PM. Needless to say, missed flight. American Airline customer service unapologetically offered a hotel and a 9:30 AM flight the next day as only option. Problem - had appointment that I could not miss at 9;30 AM in Augusta. I pushed it - wanted a rental, AA agent got a bit nasty. No rentals available, took car service back (probably cheaper than a 1 way rental in the end). Still arguing with AA - they claim total liability is $90 - the land mile % of total trip that was unused. They blame wind, weather, airport flight controllers and ""me"". I have been an engineer and project manager for almost 20 years, part of the measurement of my job performance is my ability to meet schedule commitments. Why is it that AA believes meeting schedule commitments is optional?"
"   Austin to El Paso via Dallas. My bag was lost when I arrived to El Paso, TX at 12pm. My bag was not delivered until past 7pm. I wasted all evening waiting for my bag and had to cancel plans that I was not able to reschedule. When checking in my bag, a group of four ladies chatted away while several people waited in line. A woman then made a smart comment about using the qiosk to check in our bags. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the qiosks are meant for busy times. There were enough staff members to help those who were in line but they appeared to be too busy to do their job. Needless to say, I will stick to using Southwest Airlines in the future whom I've never had issues with."
"   Avoid American Airlines at all cost. They could not care less about their customers. I spent 17 hours at different airports all do to with American Airlines problems. Starting my flights in Salisbury, MD. Supposed to have a connection in Charlotte, then on to Fort Lauderdale. The first flight being overbooked. Thinking I was helping out the airline, I accepted a 300 dollar voucher and rebooked on a flight that should have gotten me into Fort Lauderdale earlier than my original flight. Now the fun starts, arriving at the first airport at 5am and finally getting to my destination 17 hours later. The first flight of the day was overbooked. The 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems causing me to miss my connection because of the delayed flight. Since I missed my connection American Airlines tried to find another flight for me, the next flight they offered was almost 10 hours hanging out in the Philadelphia airport before taking off. Then they found a different flight leaving about 3 hours later with another connection in Charlotte. When we arrived in Charlotte, the American Airlines gate area was a total mad house. People standing everywhere up against each other and people sitting on the floor, because of American Airlines problems. It felt like there was no air conditioning, because of all the people in a small area. They were all talking on the microphones at the same time, mentioning delays and offering 900 dollars or more for giving up flights. Now the connecting flight in Charlotte then was delayed several times. Because of all the problems with American Airlines, I missed a lunch and dinner. Also a friend had to rent a 2nd car, because I was the one with the car rental for the trip. Once I got home a few days later I contacted American Airlines and explained the situation, and to let them know I was not pleased. Of course I get a company generated form letter, not even mentioning my complaint, just stating policies. This company could care less about their customers and how they treat them. Being such a large company, they should be more concerned about customer relations. Also looking at this site with reviews, I am not the only person who will not use or recommend American Airlines."
"   Awful customer service at check in. First time flying with my infant (in lap) son, with my mom, and was told we were seated together. Wasn't until actual check in we found out we weren't and when asked to change it, was told there was nothing they could do for us. Had to call Delta three times to finally receive email confirmation of ticket purchase. Also, ""valet checked"" my sons stroller and upon arriving in Atlanta, the sun visor was missing. Tried to talk to gate agent in ATL but was told to do that in Fort Smith (my final destination). Upon arriving there, I was told I should have filed in Atlanta so they can't help me, but here's a phone number. I called it and filed a claim, only to be told Fort Smith should have done that for me and I was simply brushed off. It's been almost 3 weeks since I filed the claim and still have not heard from Delta to replace the part on my stroller."
"   Awful flight! Our first plane had a fuel pump failure, we were stuck 3.5h on tarmac going from Atlanta to Munich. Eventually we were let out, and headed to the next plane. On the next plane we had to wait for 1:45min because it needed to be refueled, and the refueling people forgot to close the cap on the gas tank - so that took time to be resolved. I must say the crew did an excellent job dealing with all the issues. But I am very disappointed with Delta Air Lines. ATL is a major Delta hub, so how  they don't have an extra plane in case of an emergency?! Also the fact that we were kept 3.5 hours on termac was awful! It is inhuman to keep people on the plane while trying to fix it. The fumes that eventually leaked from flooded engine were suffocating us, all while we were told to hang on tight and wait until they figure out if the pump works. I know I do not spend time in my car while mechanic is working on it, so why the passengers had to stay on the plane while having mechanical issues. By far this was my worst experience flying, and I travel a lot. Overall I am greatly disappointed with how Delta handles its business when planes are facing mechanical issues. I don't blame the crew - I blame Delta."
"   Bangkok to  Indianapolis via Tokyo and Minneapolis  with Delta Air Lines. Excellent lie-flat seats on both international sectors. Very roomy flat bed.  Delta staff were professional and friendly. From Tokyo he captain talked to Business Class in person before take off. “We know you paid a lot for these seats and we want to thank you for choosing Delta. You keep us in business."" Then the spiel about the 4 pilots in the cockpit. Food very good. I ordered Lacto- Ovo Vegetarian meals. I arrived in Indianapolis on time and rested with all of my bags."
   Barcelona to New York JFK on 15th July. The flight was delayed by 3 hours and the crew was rude. I was with my 9 year old son and we were sitting on seats 54H/54J. I requested the Flight attendant working that section guy to help me put my bag up on the storage and he said we are here to assist and not help - very rude and obnoxious. Customer service at Delta in general is just horrible.
"   Barcelona to New York. Truly disappointed. We paid big bucks for this international flight. We had issues on our way to Barcelona with British Airways and back with American. Both times we were greeted with customer service that was quite awful. There were a few friendly faces, but what affected me most was the check-in lady who literally yelled at me and the people in front of us in line and then a flight attendant who also yelled at me about food on the flight, because I had my headphones in and missed her when she first spoke. When I removed my earbud and said sorry, she then proceeded to refuse me service. I come from hospitality and I know it's a tough job...but I also know you stay positive no matter what. I can honestly say I'll never book American again - if I'm almost to tears twice because of people due to flying then I will say that is enough. Goodbye American."
"   Being able to fly First Class on a transcontinental route (New York to San Diego) is certainly a treat that I looked forward to. I decided to treat myself to the Admirals Club at JFK which to me was one of the highlights of the journey. Great healthy snacks, fresh guacamole and well made cocktails. The aircraft cabin was standard with leather seats, ample space and well stocked personal Samsung tablets. Now, I believe First Class service should be special including the check-in, what happened to the First Class Check in? It's just ""Priority""! The food was quite tasty albeit the meals were different from what the web-site listed in the pre-order. Here's the issue: the FA's were nothing but robotic and functioning. Fake smiles with minimal service. One drink service, expedited food presentation and that was it! I had to get up to get a simple glass of water. More time was spent in the galley complaining to each other about the company, which was easy to over hear, rather then taking caring of the premium paying passengers, First Class FA's should represent the high standard of the Airline. American is doing a great job but customer service should be a paramount determinant."
"   Boise to Dublin via New York. Had to get home for my grannys funeral, spent $1175.78 for the ticket. Trip from Dublin to Boise all was fine. On way back, left Boise to Salt Lake City, told there was going to be just over an hour delay, I asked at the Delta desk, will I make my connector at JFK to Dublin, was told yes. Left SLC about 30 minutes into flight, flight was told they were doing construction on runways at JFK. Right before we landed at JFK, they made an announcement to the flight to please let ones who were connecting to Dublin off the flight first as we needed to make our connection. Well, there were about 18-20 of us that missed the flight to Dublin by 8 minutes. Yes, 8 minutes Delta would not hold the flight for us. 10:05pm in JFK and we were told plane left, no flight for 24 hours, I asked if they had a motel for us or any food vouchers - anything, we were told as a group, no. Slept on the floor of JFK Airport tell 8am the next morning then spent $60.00 of my money to check into the Delta Club, yes I got to take a shower and eat and rest, but I feel that of no fault of mine, Delta could have made a little effort to hold the connecting flight for 8 minutes or help all the folks that were in the same position as I was for 24 hours."
"   Bonaire to Salt Lake City via Atlanta. There were a number of issues on this flight - some beyond the control of the airline. But Delta failed to cater an international flight of over 5 hours duration. There were no first class meals at all and not enough coach meals to go around. Passengers were asked to share which was OK because the sandwich they provided to me was soggy - almost soaking wet and smelled so bad I refused to eat it in any event. Beverages were also in short supply and at the end of the flight as a first class passenger I was offered a choice of Diet Coke or tomato juice only. According to staff the plane should have been catered for the return flight in Atlanta and that did not get done. Flight crew advised that they had asked the terminal staff in Bonaire to make an announcement that if you wanted food or drink you needed to buy it before boarding. If that was done neither myself or anyone I talked to in first class heard the announcement. Flight crew promised that Delta would have a representative at the gate in Atlanta to do something for our inconvenience - that was a pipe dream. Due to the delays I had to run to clear customs, immigration and make my next flight out of Atlanta - also in the first class cabin but with no meal service. So I had a 12 hour travel day with a soggy, inedible sandwich and two bags of chips. I am a frequent business traveler and I avoid Delta whenever I can because they always lose bags, have issues with departure times etc etc. My first Delta flight since 2011 shows they have not changed their stripes."
"   Booked a seat for my mother Columbus to Washington for tomorrow March 4. She could not find her photo ID due to early stages of dementia. Called AA to change her reservation to a week later. Was informed there is a $200 ""reservation change"" charge (Ticket cost only $177). The agent based in of Dallas/Fort Worth was very understanding and extremely helpful when she offered to change the reservation date at no extra charge. In my opinion, she went above and beyond in helping me and I am very grateful. Thank you, American Airlines!"
   Booked on 6:30 am flight to Ronald Reagan airport to leave from gate A8 in Cincinnati. Sent to gate A6 until boarding time 6am. Then sent back to A8 and at 7:02am the flight shows up on gate sign as on time. Flight is actually a half hour late and counting. Every time I fly American out of Cincinnati Northern KY airport the American employees distinguish themselves as incompetent and uncaring people. No credible information is shared with paying customers. I've been lied too on more than one occasion. The American airline personnel do not know the value of good honest customer service.
"   Booked to fly from Seattle to Indianapolis. First off, this is my fourth (and final) flight with American Airlines in the past month. Every single flight has been delayed for one reason or another resulting in me missing two flights. Then when you go to the agent and set up a new flight that's not for five more hours they act like they're doing you a favor by moving you up two rows in the flight. I won't be flying American anymore, I shouldn't have strayed from Alaska/Delta."
"   Boston to Atlanta. Still waiting at the airport, my flight was changed and delayed 3 times, all they blame is on Boston Logan airport, due to construction. Don't they know in advance the going construction ? And change their flights in advance too we been waiting here for 6 hours and Delta is not doing anything for us, worst customer service."
"   Boston to Charlottesville via La Guardia. Worst airline experience!  Both my flights (BOS-LGA delayed from 7pm to 8:30pm and LGA-CHO delayed from 9 pm to 11 pm) were delayed by couple of hours which was fine and understood - but just 30 mins before my 2nd flight (at 8:30 for LGA-CHO) they emailed me that the 2nd leg of the flight will be on time and the first flight won't reach on time for me to even think about rushing and getting to gate to try to make it. Cherry on the cake they did not even wait for few passengers going to CHO and said you are scheduled for next afternoon now via Atlanta - so basically by the time I reach my final destination it will be 7pm of next day. By the way, no apologies at all during the whole 24 hrs process. Will never fly Delta!"
   Boston to Chicago. Such a disappointment. Customer service was rough if you fly business or economy no one cares no matter how much money you spend on the ticket. Front desk are cold and lazy. Cant get into the lounge even if you are flying business - they only let members into the lounge what's up with that? People paying for the cheap seats get in but those spending the extra dollar are refused.
"   Boston to Daytona Beach via Atlanta. My son and I along with hundreds of other passengers were left stranded on a tarmac with the captain and crew absolutely clueless as to what to do. There was no place to park the plane they said. I pointed out several open terminals out the window and even suggested a manual exit like you see done every day. Instead, Delta left us on the plane like cattle for hours. Shame on you delta."
   Boston to Detroit. Big shout out to the gentleman flight attendant who gave the whole plane a Vegas worthy magic show! Made the flight enjoyable and the whole plane was laughing the whole way it was awesome. I hope Delta hires more people like him who really take pride in their job!
"   Boston to Guatemala City via Atlanta. This is the first time that I've flown in a number of years. I don't usually fly with Delta when I do fly, but there were several aspects to this trip which were disappointing. My wife and I went on a missions trip to Guatemala. Of the 16 of us, baggage was delayed for 5!! For one person, it was delayed for 2 days (out of a 7 day trip!). The Guatemalan baggage attendant did not provide a file reference number to us (which we needed for baggage charge reimbursement purposes), so I just completed an online letter to them explaining why I cannot complete their online form (wasting more of my time). Additionally, on the trip home, we actually happened to get upgraded to a ""comfort plus"" seat. The desk attendant told us it cost an extra $100 for these seats and we would get a complementary drink if we desired. The leg room was definitely better, but that was it. We were never offered any drink, and the service/attention we received was no different than in economy - which, in my opinion, was also sub-par. With the financial windfall airlines have enjoyed the last few years, I would expect more - and also cannot understand why they charge for 1 checked bag at all! In sum, this Delta experience was mediocre."
   Boston to Harrisburg. Flight was delayed without assigning any reasons. Boarding delayed for 45 mins without any announcement. Took one hour to taxi on the runway for take off. Flight attendant very rude when was requested to let me go to the restroom since the takeoff was delayed by one hour. Kept on yelling and insulting in spite of being told that due to bladder problems I cannot hold urine for long. Extremely rude customer service.
"   Boston to La Guardia. At boarding gate, suddenly American Airlines announced the flight is delayed from 12.00 to 2pm without any prior notice at check in or earlier. I booked for first class but then got downgrade if I want to go earlier flight at 1 pm. I have no choice and they told me there won't be any compensation. Only 1 staff working at the gate trying to fix this problem for the whole plane passenger. Very bad management and unacceptable problem solving."
"   Boston to Lubbock via Dallas Ft Worth. I was at the gate with time to spare. I purposely did not check a bag, because I wouldn't have time to go to baggage claim when I landed. I understand when they just check it below, then hand it to you when you get off, but they fully checked it. I told her I didn't want it checked. She tried to act like she was doing me a favor by not charging me. Additionally, they tried to check it for the wrong city! The lady was extremely rude about it as well."
"   Boston to Memphis via Chicago. American Airlines are the worst. Delayed flight 5 times in 20-30 minute increments. Had they been honest from the jump I could have made other arrangements. Airline ticket is a contract allowing 2 carry on bags, which AA are now claiming isn't the case on this aircraft though the fine print neglects to mention that. They demanded I part with valuables and check bag to fly. (Literally just got off AA flight that allowed it- standard size carry on). The flight attended looked me in the eye and point blank lied at 9:45, claiming the flight was leaving at 10. "
"   Boston to Minneapolis via La Guardia. Zero customer service. Our flight was cancelled from New York LGA to Minneapolis and American Airlines will not offer any hotel vouchers any cots, blankets or food. I will never ever fly with American Airlines again. Our customer service agent was texting her friends while we were waiting for her answers. One agent got up and walked away and there were 30 people waiting. "
   Boston to New York JFK. A very unprofessional airline. If you don't want to be frustrated dont travel with American Airlines. Today 28 March I boarded on time to go to JFK and at the last minute they announced that the flight is cancelled. No reason. I was suposed to connect to an international flight from JFK but I missed it. They gave me a late flight via LGA instead of JFK. they didn pay for my hotel and worse still they even didn't apologise. 
"   Boston to Philadelphia. Delayed Flights. I fly instead of taking the bus so that I can save time and cut the long traveling time. And that's why I am even ready to spend more dollars. But American Airlines flights are always delayed for more than an hour. And it happened to me not just once but 4 or 5 times. Once, my flight was delayed by 5 hours. Typically it is a 45min. flight from Boston to Philadelphia. And the bus takes about 7 hours. But when I fly with American Airlines, the travel time is almost similar to a bus journey. They always have maintainance issue with their flights and I always end up spending 1-2 hours in the airport or flight, waiting for it to take off. And they never compensate for this delay in anyway. I am completely disappointed with American Airlines."
"   Buffalo to Jacksonville via Charlotte. An hour of gate delays after boarding made for a very tight connecting flight with no assistance, which isn't required but would be appreciated. The real gripe is the ticket takers were notified that carry on space was reached and despite major concerns that $75,000 worth of camera equipment was not something to risk lightly. I was given no choice in the matter - and getting on the flight to find five bins and room for a dozen bags remained. Flight attendants claimed it was too late to get a bag seven feet from where we were standing because it was across the threshold. This a broken process handled by bitter agents."
"   Calgary to Sacramento via Salt Lake. We never actually made it to our destination. I'm actually sitting in Seattle Airport (not on our original itinerary, but I will explain) waiting for our flight back to Calgary. So, our first flight was from Calgary to Salt Lake City. Get called up to the front desk, turns out they overbooked the flight and I was the lucky overbooked passenger. So, my boyfriend and I agreed to get on a different flight to Seattle, which would get us to Sacramento an hour later than we intended (which isn't too bad). We land in Seattle and they change gates in a different terminal right before the flight. We rush over, plane is delayed an hour. Get on the plane, they inform us of an engine leak. Fix that, say we are on our way. About 40 minutes later, we all get back off the plane. To end this quickly, we are still in Seattle but now waiting for our flight to Calgary. As university students, going on short trips is something you save for. I lost not only a planned weekend (hotels etc) but an entire day at an airport we were never supposed to be at. All due to overbooking. However, I will say that all staff was sympathic and as helpful as they could be. Today was awful and so was this experience. I've heard a few horror stories of Delta, but have now experienced one."
"   Cancun to Charleston via Miami. After sitting on the plane for two hrs we finally take off, when landing in Miami with enough time to get through customs and make our flight American Airlines sends us to line where we stand for 45 mins and still with time to spare say they can’t keep us on our flight (most likely gave our seats away). They book us on another flight 5 hrs later and as a “sorry” give us a $24 voucher. I will never fly American Airlines again. This is absolute garbage and completely ruined our honeymoon. Maybe focus on customer service and not money!"
"   Cancun to Knoxville. American Airlines is one of the worst airlines out there. They overbook and the planes are very much out of date. Our plane in August to St. Thomas looked straight out of 1970 with no in flight entertainment. Still even has ashtrays. How is that for a 4 hour flight? We paid way too much for that type of service! Unfortunately where we live and want to fly to, we have 2 choices which are AA and Delta. From now on, we will try and take Delta. Our last 3 experiences with AA have been lackluster. We were bumped from our return flight we made 7 months in advance with little compensation. They put us up at a hotel and gave us each $20 for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. Breakfast alone was $23 per person plus tax for a buffet so you can imagine how much lunch and dinner was. The hotel AA put us in said AA overbooks and bumps people often! Not to mention the extra money we had to pay for pet sitters and time missed from work coming back over 24 hours late. They made very little apologies. After emailing back and forth, I finally got $200 flight vouchers. But it didn’t come easy. Plus we have to go through Charlotte, NC for connecting flights which is the rudest airport I have ever been in."
"   Cancun to Orlando. I was positively surprised by Delta's staff good attitude, not common in US carriers. Flight departed on time, seat comfort was acceptable with standard First domestic class pitch. Plane was clean and flight attendants were alert to serve during the short flight between Cancun and Orlando."
   Cancun to Salt Lake City. I was impressed by the staff on this flight.  I had one passenger behind me having a serious panic attack. The flight attendants did everything to comfort her and help her in any way possible. The passenger sitting in front of her ( next to me) spoke rudely and disrepectfully about the poor lady having the panick attack only adding to the situation. The flight attendants asked politely for the women in front to move her seat forward in exchange for complimentary drinks the rest of the flight. To help the women feel more comfortable having the panic attack. The lady flat refused loudly and rudely. During all of this. As if they didnt have their hands full they had 3 different people  who repetitively pressed the assistance button to demand alcholic beverages. One group pressed the button non stop for 5 minutes until they where helped.  The flight attendant apologized and made them aware of the situation.  So I applaud the flight attendants on this flight.  I would never wish a group of customers like that on anyone. 
"   Cancun to San Francisco via Los Angeles. I have never been on a more frustrating flight. First, our flight was delayed an hour and a half (from 6pm to 7:30pm). Then, another hour and a half delay (7:30 to 9pm) Then after we finally boarded the plane and they made sure we were buckled in and ready to go, they let us know that another flight with higher priority took our slot at SFO and our flight was cancelled. I called customer service immediately and they let me know, they booked us on a flight at 8am the next morning! Keep in mind we were catching a connecting flight so we would've had to get hotel rooms for a family of 8 due to their mistake. I was then told my only other option was an extremely reduced per ticket refund because I had already flown most of the way. I dont know about others, but I dont like booking flights for ""most of the way there"". I took their refund and my family and I rented a car from LAX to SFO. Customer service over the phone was shoddy to say the least and the people at the gate were completely useless! They were dismissive and rude at the gate. I will never again fly this airline."
"   Cedar Rapids to Grand Forks via Minneapolis. This is just a little kudos to the two Delta employees working in Minneapolis, gate A2. They created such an atmosphere of teamwork and positive attitude that I saw it spill put amongst the passengers. Real laughter, helping people, and I am impressed. Keep it up!"
"   Charleston SC to Chicago IL. Maintenance issue we were told was fixed wasn't fixed. Had us board the plane anyway. Sat without updates for an hour then ended up unboarding the plane. We were told there was a flight shortly after out, but then updated that if we checked a bag they couldn't get out bags on soon enough to take it. Tried calling customer service and was ""helped"" by a rude woman. Took to tweeting and stopped getting responses. Called Amex to see if they could help and were really nice but they got put on a 30 min hold with Delta. Stood at the help desk at the airport the whole time and finally got helped and moved to the next flight out. Going to miss a funeral due to the delays and inefficiencies."
"   Charleston to Indianapolis via Washington. The employees at the Ronald Regan Washington DC airport have no people skills. I missed my connection due to air traffic and was denied any type of voucher. The captain said it was weather related, but when we arrived there was barely any evidence of weather ever having occurred. This airport was the most unpleasant leg of my trip both going and returning. Employees were rude to me at every turn as if I'm supposed to know how these things operate. I was told to ""back up and get out of my face"" after running to a podium to try to connect with said missed flight when I was only verifying that the flight was indeed gone. I was told ""ma'am calm down"" when I came to the gate after being called and asked what I needed to do. I am very laid back and patient, so this was uncalled for. These people are disorganized and undertrained. I will pay the extra money to use a different airline next time since I saved nothing after having to pay for the hotel from my missed flight. "
"   Charlestown to Atlanta via New Orleans. I booked a flight on Delta.com 6 months in advance and at the time was not given an assigned seat at that time. As the trip got closer I tried to see if I could get assigned seats so I was sure my wife and I were sitting together. I was told that there was a $50 upgrade fee in order to get assigned seats. I fly 2-5 times a year and I thought this was strange, I had never heard of this before on any airline. The day before our flights I received an email from Delta that they had changed the times of all of our flights. We booked our flights at specific times because we were meeting another couple in New Orleans. because of the flight change they were going to have to sit in the airpot for 2 hours waiting for us. When we arrived to check in they tried to bump us to an even later flight. on our connecting flight they did the same thing. On the return flight our plane arrived early but the gate was damaged and we had to be towed to another gate. This caused us to miss our connecting flight leaving us stranded in the airport for more than 4 hours. We had to scramble to make arrangements while going from gate to gate in the airport only to get home well after 12am. A 14 hour travel day. After almost two hours on the phone with Delta's support they offered us a $100 voucher. That was my last Delta flight. There are plenty of airlines to choose from. Why fly with a company that doesn't value you as a customer?"
"   Charlotte to Boston via Laguardia. Our flight was delayed twice, and we sat in the airport waiting, only to learn that the delay was due to mandatory 10 hour rest requirement for the flight crew. So they knew at least 10 hours ago the length of time the flight would be delayed, and did not post it or communicate it to passengers. They just kept announcing incremental delays with new departure times which were never going to happen, wasting everyone's time. We could have left home for our flight a couple hours later. They could do better."
"   Charlotte to Los Angeles. Posting this as I was surprised that American Airlines doesn't provide blankets to coach class, only to first class passengers. I normally fly with Delta, and they have never failed to provide blankets. Just so you are informed and can be prepared. The flight attendants are not as attentive."
"   Charlotte to Orlando Melbourne. It's so great that on my flight I was seated next to a man that took up his entire seat and half of mine. It's also fun that I physically couldn't put the seat divider between him and myself because he took up two seats and was sitting on top of me the whole flight, while I practically sit in the aisle way. My favorite part though has to be how I paid money to be extremely uncomfortable, to have the flight attendants do nothing, and for customer service to tell me they basically don't care."
"   Charlotte to Orlando. The man working at the desk where you scan you ticket was so rude. He looked at my bag and said it was too big to carry on and said it wouldn't fit. He was rude the way he said it. My bag has fit on every plane I've taken it on. Including the American Airlines flight I just got off of 1 hour ago. There was plenty of room on the overhead compartments went I got on the plane, now I'm inconvenienced by having to stop by baggage claim."
"   Charlotte to San Diego. This was a 5 hour flight and this was an ex US Airways A321. It did have the refurbished interior with new seat covers and carpets and overall a fresh clean cabin. But there were still no plugs, no IFE, just Wi Fi and GoGo movie streaming thru the American app (it actually worked very well, no issues at all and a decent selection of movies). But it makes no sense how they can put power ports on their 18 year old Ex US Air A319s but not a 3 year old Ex US Air A321. Nonetheless the seats were very comfortable with acceptable legroom and service was ok, FAs were average for a US airline, Flight left on time and arrived in San Diego 15 minutes early. Only thing I have to say is other than the red stripe on top of the seats the cabin was very very bland. Literally an all grey interior, grey bulkheads with no logos anywhere, grey and navy blue seats, grey carpet, practically all grey livery. Pretty dismal, also the cost for full Wi-Fi access is obnoxious. I bought a messsaging pass for 2 dollars which claimed it worked on skype but Skype said no internet, I could only use iMessage (no SMS) and I couldn't send pictures which was annoying because when I bought GoGo on US Airways in 2014 I could send and post pictures. AA doesn't like to say these Ex US Airways A321s exist, to know what kind of plane you are on look at the plane type on your reservation when you get your ticket. the Ex US Air A321 will be marked ""321"" the new refurbished one with IFE and plugs is marked ""32B"""
"   Charlotte to Wilkes Barre. This will definitely be the last time I will ever fly this airline. I asked downstairs if my carry on baggage was ok size and they informed me it was ok then I get to the gate and because I am zone 9 then I am not allowed to have a suitcase it has to be a duffel bag. Then I was told I had to check it or rebook for in the morning. So I had to pay the $50 and I could have checked it downstairs for only $25!  American Airlines guess that's one way to get money, but definitely not the honest way to get it. The plane is NOT full so there is more than enough room for my 1 bag!"
"   Charlotte, NC to Spokane, WA via Minneapolis. I rarely fly Delta. Out of the four times I've flown Delta two of those have resulted in ""maintenance issues"" resulting in delays over two hours. Currently as I write this review I am sitting on my plane because of a ""maintenance issue."" We have been sitting here over an hour in the plane and even the pilot says no one has told him the status yet. The last time I flew Delta before today my early flight from Las Vegas to Spokane, WA was delayed twelve hours because of another ""maintenance issue."" Needless to say, I'm avoiding Delta like a plague now."
"   Chattanooga to Orlando via Charlotte. My flight out was ok, delayed a little bit but nothing too bad. Arrived about an hour or so late so wasn't able to get to my hotel until around 2am. On my return flight I arrived a couple hours early and decided to get a drink and some food. About an hour or so before my flight I was notified that my flight was delayed until 9:15pm which meant I would miss my connecting flight. When I went to the ticket counter, there was no rep there. I waiting with another passenger for around 30 min before a rep showed up. When I was finally able to ask her what was going on with my flight she informed me that they had canceled the flight and that it would be leaving the following morning. When I asked her why she said they didn't have enough people to man the flight. I asked her to put me on another flight, but there were no more flights that day. Keep in mind this was around 6pm. When I asked for a refund she said she couldn't do that and looked away from me back at her screen. When I asked how to get a refund she told me in a very sarcastic voice to ""just call American."" At that point I unloaded on her and her horrible customer service and went to Delta and bought another ticket for $171.38. When I called AA to get a refund they told me it would take up to 10 days and that they couldn't tell me what amount would be refunded. I waited 11 days with no refund. When I called back in to AA they said no one had filled the refund. Once again I had to go through the process and wait. I finally go a notice that my refund of $115 was being ""processed"" but could take up to 5 days to complete. When I reached someone in customer service they seemed very unapologetic, like I was a nuisance. I tried to get someone to explain to me why my refund, which should have been $214 because of the seats I purchased, was so low they said, ""that is the amount our refund department issues."" No other explanation was given. I have since canceled my AAdvantage membership and made sure that anyone in my company that flies does not use American or any affiliate. Customer service and customer relations for American is a joke."
"   Chicago to Albany. In the past year I have travelled around the world and American Airlines is by far the worst I have encountered. Customers are treated with disrespect, not given updated information, and not treated fairly. Flights are delayed and cancelled due to maintenance issues. This airline does not warrant it's name. Pitiful."
"   Chicago to Atlanta. Had a problem with my upgrade not showing on ticket. When I arrived at the counter to pre-check my bag, the staff was not only polite he had a smile on his face the entire time. That's a simple thing that is too often forgotten. But can make my choice of doing business with Delta a continuous success. "
"   Chicago to Boston. Short-changed on a paid upgrade. This was a late evening flight that got delayed by half an hour (and for the first time on American I heard the pilot actually acknowledge and apologize). Security at O'Hare was a bit of a zoo and most food outlets were shutting down as I got through. Since I have status and the cost would be $80 I paid for two 500 mile upgrade vouchers in the hope of getting bumped. My seat was already in main cabin extra with reasonable legroom, and I fly this route at least monthly but given the late hour and my hunger I thought I would enjoy an upgrade. The product was very disappointing and not worth $80. We were offered nuts which I can't eat due to an allergy. I was given a snack pack as an alternative. I was in seat 3E, legroom wasn't amazing. Seat comfort was ok but nothing special. I had a couple of drinks. Food and beverage value maybe $35 for a snack pack and a couple of whiskies (but they often comp your second if you buy two in economy so not that good). Slightly better seat but not much better than main cabin extra. No meal, no entertainment. Wifi is paid for either way and I never use it. I really feel ripped off, the upgrade really isn't worth the difference."
"   Chicago to Dallas Ft Worth, my flight departure time was 4:25pm but departed 6 hours later at about 10:30pm.  We arrived the following day after 1200am! Never were we given an apology, or an explanation for the constant gate changes and updated departure times. We waited 4 hours before we boarded, after we finally board waited 1 hour, before we were informed that we had to deplane, and go through that same process again. No apologies, no sorry for your inconveniences - why waste time on apologies when AA aren’t legally entitled to compensation, only a refund of the ticket price you paid. The airline won’t cover any incidental costs either, such as the fare difference of having to book a more expensive flight on another airline or that you’ll now need to spend an extra night in a hotel, etc."
"   Chicago to Hartford. Made us sit on a 100+ degree plane on the runway for almost 2 hours. The air conditioning was broken. After pulling away from the gate and suffering in this sauna plane for 3 hours they announced that it wouldn’t be fair to make us sit in the hot airplane for the flight. We were told we would have to return to the gate, which took another 45 minutes. The entire flight would have taken 1.5 hours, we spent more than twice that time on the hot airplane! Their reasoning for not taking off was that they didn’t want us to be uncomfortable! We are deplaning now, this story is not yet over. Also, this plane is brand new, but the only update seems to be that they took away more space from each individual passenger. Literally forced to lean forward in this seat"
"   Chicago to Indianapolis. There’s a reason American Airlines is not my preferred carrier and today’s experience served to push them much further down the list. Traveling with the same baggage I carried a week earlier on United, American decided that gouging $25 to check a bag wasn’t insult enough; they forced me to check a second bag for an outrageous $35 more. United charged quite enough at $25. American lamely pointed to their 'policy', but it is those very policies that will keep me out of their seats."
"   Chicago to London Heathrow. On time departure and arrival in a clean Boeing 787-8. Crew smiling and polite, service was exceptional and the food really good. Extra snacks and many rounds of drinks were provided too. Legroom was ok but since I am a big guy it could be better, but still not an issue. Entertainment system was very good with a wide selection of movies, games, music etc. Overall a great experience.
"
"   Chicago to Manchester, UK. So disappointed with the customer service from American. Mechanical issues delayed our flight 15 hours overnight, before they just cancelled the flight without notifying us when we would be rebooked. Due to these mechanical issues and the minimal communication, we are spending Christmas Eve and Christmas stranded at the airport. It's a real shame since we can't get more vacation time from work and haven't been to see family in over a year! Can't trust American to get us there anymore."
"   Chicago to Orlando. I booked airline tickets for my son, my then husband, and myself in January 2017 for travel from ORD to MCO in April 2017. Then I ended up getting asked for a divorce in early April. I was able to cancel my flight and leave my tickets open in the hope that I could re-allocate my ex-husbands and still be able to take a vacation with my son this year. When it became apparent that I could not take a vacation this year I asked for some sort of a refund from American and cited my divorce as a cause and offered to send the notorized copies of my paperwork to them to prove what caused me to be unable to travel. American refused, saying that this is not an exception and I would get nothing in return and the tickets have to be used by those whose names appear on them. I can neither afford to travel, due to my divorce nor am I willing to contact my ex husband to offer him his ticket. American then said the matter would have no further correspondence. Their complete lack of compassion or any customer service at all has been astounding for such a large airline. I will never travel with them again and urge others to do the same."
"   Chicago to Salt Lake City. Can someone please tell me why when I make my reservations weeks is advance, I am not given the option to select a seat? Then when I check in 24 hrs in advance, they again will not give me an option to select a seat? Then, I have to go to the counter to get a seat even assigned to me. Then, when I request an isle or a window I am told (with a sarcastic laugh) no due to it being an oversold flight? How again an oversold flight is my problem? I followed protocol and I get punished as a customer. I tried Delta again after a while of not using them due to similar issues, but I am sorry to say it's back to American Airlines for me. I'm sure Delta will never read this and even if they do they won't care, I'm just trying to protect fellow passengers who spend their hard earned money on this ridiculous company. Save your money and fly elsewhere!"
"   Chicago to Shanghai. Started out at the AA Lounge on Floor Two of the Admiral's Club, which is actually a Flagship Lounge. I did not expect much for a US carriers premium club, but was gladly surprised. Many hot Breakfast items, cold as well along with a host of other assorted goodies. Definitely worth a visit. You only need you boarding pass to show to the desk agent, to gain access. Must be a Business Class member or Ex Plat. Boarded early. Yes, an announcement is made in the club. Had seat 1L on the Boeing 787-8. I felt that it was kind of tight and the anchor was attached to seat 2L. Meaning you felt every movement of the other passenger. Although close to the galley for prompt service, kind of bothersome during the flight. Service was excellent. Food presentation and taste not so much. If you like a good cheese platter, you wont find it here, however, the attention to detail of the FA's very good. Plenty of current and classic DVD's to watch. Overall very satisfied with AA's service, but look to the Asian Carriers for a bit more care all around"
"   Cincinnati to Birmingham via Charlotte. I'm trying to remain kind and sweet, but this is the third flight with American Airlines in the span of 3 days that has been delayed, resulting in an overnight stay, and arriving a day later than planned to my destination. Customer service was nonchalant and unapologetic when I missed my connecting flight as a result of delays. If at all possible, I will avoid flying with American Airlines in the future."
"   Cincinnati to Salt Lake City via Chicago. We purchased flights for our family of six (4 kids under age 6) to go to my husbands sisters wedding (Dec. 21st-25th from CVG-SLC) and my husband just injured his back Monday morning. I sent a letter through the online form to customer relations. Customer relations called me back this morning and said that all they can do is waive the change fee ($200 per person) for future travel because it was a nonrefundable ticket. I asked to talk to someone else. He said there is no one else to talk to and no number I can call and nothing else can be done. This is a family emergency and that is all they can do? They didn't ask to see the doctors note or a history of injuries he has had. It is hard for me to believe that after choosing them over every other airlines, they can be so cold to us. The flight date is not past. They could still fill the seats we won't use and I am sure some other family would be so glad to get to fly during this busy time, as we would have, had this not happened. A refund should be so simple."
"   Cleveland to Amsterdam via Atlanta. Really really horrible customer service at their own hub airport in Atlanta. Flight delayed due to their maintenance issue, connection missed and they treat you like you're some annoying homeless person and at first tell you to go to 5 different places, then when you're at the right place, you are not allowed to ask a question without standing first in line for 4 hours (yes 4 hours starting at 12 am) when you get to the counter you're being told that they won't help you because some system error airline didn't release the ticket and they will wait until 8 am when the airline opens at their airport. You're not getting a hotel because they have none available from their partners! So they expect you to ""hang-around"" for 20 hours after already traveling for long to wait for your flight giving you a 15$ voucher for food! This is the most ridiculous service I've ever experienced. When I summed up the fact that they made me wait in line for 4 hours to tell me they won't help me, they denied ever telling me to stand in the line. Very rude and arrogant staff. Last thing you want to experience on a long journey. Avoid Delta at all costs."
"   Cleveland to Minneapolis via Chicago. I have never had such a disorganized, rude, and downright horrible customer service experience. Our first flight was delayed because of one single passenger's passport not going through. A flight full of about 60-70 people delayed 45 minutes for one individual - which should have been figured out by removing her from the flight, as there were many people (at least 25) whom had connecting flights they had to get to, including us. We had a connecting flight in Chicago that was leaving 30 minutes after we landed, prior to the delay time. We were instructed to call the delay hotline to find flights for our party of 8 from Chicago to Minneapolis, in case we did not make it in time to catch our connection. We arrived with about 10 minutes to spare because of a delay in the mechanics with said connecting flight. We got to the gate to assure we were going to make it and it turns out the hotline screwed up 3 of our seats and booked us for a flight leaving 5 hours later than our original take off time that we sprinted through O'Hare airport to make. While I understand screw ups, the attitudes of the ladies at the gate was absolutely unacceptable. Not once did we receive an apology, nor did they seem willing to help, even though we were originally very calm and cooperative. They acted as if it was our fault and even made a comment about my manners, while they continued to treat us poorly. They were well aware of the situation and knew our flight was arriving with little time to make it to the gate and knew the number of seats that were needed. It was in no way our fault, as we did as we were instructed each step of the way. I will never be flying American Airlines again and hope  I never have to deal with another one of the employees I encountered in this entire experience."
"   Columbus to Chicago. The worst experience I’ve had flying with an airline. The tickets are much more expensive than their competitors (Southwest, etc) and there is less room for seating and less room for carry-ons to be stowed above. The overhead storage space is so limited that I had to check a carry-on I brought, which may cause fragile items to be damaged. When asked about why I would have to check this, the female attendant spoke with an extremely annoyed and sarcastic tone telling me “well that’s too bad, you can take a seat and book another flight”. This is awful practice, and is a mystery to me why a person like this is getting paid to represent a company. I will never fly with American Airlines again, and I suggest anyone considering flying with them abandon that idea. Also, boarding began after the scheduled time as well as take-off."
"   Columbus to Daytona Beach via Atlanta. Delta is the poorest run airline. Delays, cancellations and no updates! App stops working and looses flight data. Try to go to the counter to get assistance and after several interruptions I finally get a ticket to Orlando. Terrible experience overall, may not fly Delta again!

"   Cozumel to Denver via Dallas. Our gate was changed three times. Our flight was delayed 2 hrs, then 2.5 hrs, now 3 hrs. They officially decomissioned our plane due to mechanical issues. Dont know when or if we are going home tonight or tomorrow.  Complete, total failure. Does this flight even exist? As of 2 seconds ago, yet another gate change but crew and fictitious plane will not be ready for another 20 minutes. Thank you for ruining my Sunday and extending my travel time to 24 hrs.  Will never fly it again even if it is the cheapest. You get what you pay for! Spend your money elsewhere!"
"   Dallas Ft Worth to Abilene. American Airlines out of Abilene is inefficient, and annoying! The delays from Abilene to DFW  are frequent. Often I miss connecting flights because of these delays. The latest connector flight I missed was to go home for Christmas. Driving is a great and at times better option."
   Dallas Ft Worth to Beijing. I normally use British Airways for long haul but decided to change because of poor service. The plane was new and the business class seats comfortable. Probably the best entertainment I have seen on any flight. Food menu was bland but this is normal on some western carriers. American could be world class if only they taught their staff to be human and empathetic. If they concentrated on making the passengers comfortable rather than themselves it would have made the grade. Conclusion better than British Airways but not as good as Cathay.
   Dallas Ft Worth to Columbus. Worst customer service! I was traveling with 3 kids and had two busters which I wanted to gate check. The person at the check desk said that I need to check both busters and get them back at the baggage claim. I explained to her three times I did not wanted to check those items and retrieve them at the baggage claim. She printed out and put the papers on the busters without me agreeing to it. The other person working at the gate realized what was going on and stepped in and helped the situation. She printed out the correct tags and we were able to check the two busters at the gate and retrieve them as we walked out of the airplane. The first worker did not even apologized for her lack of customer service. Shame on this person and the airline who hires incapable people!
   Dallas Ft Worth to Denver. American Airlines overbooked our flight to Denver and said there was only three spots left. We waited 2 hours after that for them to book us another flight and on top of that the lady said I don’t get a hotel voucher or a taxi voucher. She finally gave me a hotel voucher which was 14 miles away from the airport so I had to pay $45 taxi ride to a sketchy hotel. I will never fly American Airlines again. The worst customer service I have ever encountered. I paid for a very expensive flight and hotel in Denver and didn’t get to stay in it. 
"   Dallas Ft Worth to Madrid via Atlanta. The flight from DFW to ATL boarded on time, the staff was very friendly with everyone. We got drink and snacks. Once we arrived at Atlanta I had to transfer to the international gates. The flight was pretty full the staff on this flight was outstanding, they started serving the drinks quickly then came out the food right after that. Overall a very smooth flight and they staff were very on point with keeping the drinks flowing to everyone."
"   Dallas Ft Worth to Miami in January 2017. Staffed premium counter in DFW for check-in was fast and friendly. Priority for TSA was issued, but TSA chose to close down the priority line, so back to the general line. However, the wait was not too bad. Used AAdmirals Club lounge which was a modern and comfortable facility with a nice apron view. Received a voucher for one free ""premium drink"". Food choices were rather poor (soup, cookies, vegetables and dips and cheese cubes) and all drinks were served at the manned bar, (tips expected) except tap water, coffee and tea. Most alcoholic drinks are charged at steep airport prices.  On board, pre-flight drinks were offered. Seats were very good (the same or very similar to CX) in an herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. IFE was AVOD and screen size and quality very good. Content was large and varied. Headphones were provided. WIFI was available, but too slow to be useful. A chicken couscous salad (or cheese ravioli) was served for dinner, which was very bland and bordering tasteless. Service by cabin crew was good and attentive. Overall, in my opinion AA delivers a much better experience than UA or DL. However, inflight catering is the weak point. Flight was on time. Overall again a pleasant experience for a U.S. domestic flight.."
"   Dallas Ft Worth to Salt Lake City. This is about the flight attendants on this flight. They were absolutely fantastic. I got extremely ill midway through the flight and they were ready and willing to help with whatever I needed: ginger ale, ice pack for my neck, snacks to settle my stomach. I spent most of my flight standing in the back in case and one of the women talked to me and helped take my mind off of how I was feeling. I am so grateful to those flight attendants. I'd fly Delta again simply because of them."
"   Dallas Ft Worth to San Diego. American Airlines is simply the worst airline! I would and will never fly American Airlines ever again! There is 0 leg room, the employees are rude, and their bag fees are disgusting! $50 to check a carry on bag. The lady mentioned it's a ""New"" rule. Are you kidding me? It's a new rule you charge for a carry on?  I would be embarrassed to run or work for a company like this. The last time I flew with American there flight was late by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because of it and that flight was the last flight out so we were stuck and had to pay an extra $100 for a hotel and I ended up missing my sisters wedding. Then when we landed we were stuck on the flight for 2 hours on the runway. American Airlines is a nightmare.  My time is worth more and I refuse to support a company this horrible"
"   Dallas Ft Worth to San Jose. Our flight was delayed a minimum of three hours not due to weather, but to the lack of the number of flight attendants. Unfortunate that the top can only fill two for flight attendants whenever within the first two hours after the flight was originally scheduled. After three hours, only three of the four attendants were present."
"   Dallas Ft. Worth to Atlanta. I have not flown Delta for a very long time. The seats are very small and narrow. I am not a stick thin model but I am also not a 300 lb. person. It might be a good idea to upgrade the planes and add just a little bit more width to the seats. To spend hours sitting in a very narrow seat is pretty bad. Once we landed, I was very sore when I got up."
"   Dallas to Calgary. Worst service ever. Connection got delayed, missed the next flight, two managers showed up and decided to send me off to Toronto (to get ride of me) instead of Calgary. Their explanation was ""we didnt notice"". After running around so many times, they offered me the next day flight and one night stay at Super 8, they printed off the stuff and just left."
"   Dallas to Chattanooga. This is my first and last trip on American Airlines. I flew from Chattanooga to Dallas and the attendant at the Chattanooga airport was so incredibly rude. Then, coming back from Dallas to Chattanooga, we had to wait for at least 15 minutes to depart the plane because they couldn't find a marshall to flag it in. What a joke! And Chattanooga could do so much better since the city is growing so rapidly. Bring in Southwest! They are the best and most efficient. I would rather drive to Nashville or Atlanta then fly from my hometown on this joke of an airline!"
"   Dallas to El Paso. The gate agent was rude and condescending. The $50 fee for checking your bags at the gate with an economy ticket is horrible. The price of the ticket isn't cheap enough to charge such expensive fees for baggage. That is especially true when other airlines have better ticket prices, service and cheaper baggage fees. What's going on with American Airlines? They don't care about their customers. The ticket agents and gate agents are rude and don't understand the meaning of customer service. Their review rating is the lowest among other airlines. I'm done with them."
"   Dallas to Houston. Flight was originally scheduled to leave at July 23rd 9:45pm and was delayed to 1:38am and then canceled. When I asked what my options were after waiting in line at the customer service counter, they said the next flight available would be at July 24th 5:42pm. Why on earth would it be more than a 12hr wait to one of the busiest international airports (George Bush IAH)? I got another flight with United Airlines 6:30am the next morning. They never re-imbursed me even tho they said they would."
"   Dallas to New York via Chicago and the flight was horrible. DFW-ORD was amazing but as soon as we landed, we were told of a delay because our gate was occupied and I only had a 45 mins layover. We rushed to our gate and thankfully they had delayed it. We finally boarded after a 2 hour delay and as soon as we sat down, the captain said that there was a hydraulic fluid leak and we had to deplane and board another aircraft. When we landed in NY we waited for an hour for bags and then we find out that the bags were at the wrong Carousel. We were traveling on Christmas Eve and our flight was supposed to arrive at 10:30pm but we reached at 1:00am Christmas Day. This was the Nightmare before Christmas!"
   Dallas to San Jose. The ticketing agent was rude. The plane needed maintenance. We sat on the tarmac for over an hour waiting for the mechanic. The majority of the passengers missed connections. The airlines should have maintained the equipment before boarding Passengers. If I could rate this as a zero with no stars I would.
"   Dallas to Savannah. American cancelled our flight during a mandatory evacuation during hurricane Irma. Which left us completely stranded. They rescheduled it for the day the hurricane was supposed to hit this area, which makes no sense. Even if there hadn't been a hurricane, this would have been bad news because they changed the flight from a Sunday to a Monday. I scheduled a Sunday return flight because I work on Mondays, like most people. I called their customer service and they were no help. Luckily Southwest stepped in and was able to book us a flight out of harm's way. It blows my mind that they would do that."
"   Dallas to Toronto. Booked American Airlines via Expedia. Got to the airport 7 hrs early to see if we could catch an earlier flight. We were expecting a rebooking fee. What we weren't expecting was what we were told. Were told that we had purchased ""economy"" tickets which are their form of competing with the discount airlines so ""perks"" like rescheduling were not included. Other things they told us were ""perks"": check in luggage ($25 extra each), overhead storage (not allowed), 1 carry on or personal item only (to be stored under the seat only), and the seat itself! Yes she actually said the seat is a pen and would be extra! After all that they wouldn't even seat me with my wife. We were close - 15 rows away! Currently waiting to board in 2 hours. I'm expecting them to say that if we want in-flight entertainment it would be extra and then hand me a mirror to watch my hair grow. Awful airline - save yourselves the heartache and exercise any other option. I certainly will in the future."
"   Dane County to Louisville via Detroit. I volunteered to take a later flight because they overbooked my original flight. The gate agents offered a $400 travel voucher to people willing to fly on a later flight. I volunteered and the gate agent told me he booked me on a later flight that day. My original flight ends up being about 1.5 hours delayed and at the end of boarding for the earlier flight the gate agents called my name up to the counter. At this point, the earlier flight is taxiing away from the gate and when I get up to the counter the gate agents have no idea why I'm up there. They had literally just called me to the counter and then didn't know why I was up there. Of course this concerned me so I wanted to verify my flight details for later that day. The gate agents had no idea what I was talking about. They had not booked me on that later flight. I had them book me at that point and verified with them I would still get the travel voucher. The gate agents assured me I wold still get the voucher. Of course, a couple weeks go by and nothing shows up in my Delta account so I submit a request. I finally get a call almost 2 months later from someone at Delta headquarters. She let's me know that, ""there were empty seats on the earlier flight and there was no way the gate agents would have offered me a voucher. Since I didn't get booked on the later flight until after the earlier flight, there was no way my story was true."" This entire experience was ridiculous and I will never volunteer to change flights ever again and any chance I can use United instead of Delta, I will. Everyone I talked to was nice, but almost patronizing, like there was no way my story was true. This was a very frustrating experience that has been time consuming."
"   DCA-ORD-DOH-CMB-DOH-PHL-DCA Route. This was an AAdvantage OneWorld international roundtrip award, using American Airlines (AA), Qatar Airways (QR) and SriLankan Airlines (UL). All sectors were above average, and reasonably close to being ""on time"". They connected well, and baggage was transferred with no issues. Check-in at DCA, reconfirm at ORD and check-in at CMB were very good, with CMB being the best, as UL has a separate ""Silk Route"" counter and entrance for business class. Meal service was good on all, and the seats comfortable based on flight length, with the A359, A333 and E75 being the best. Flight attendants were good on all sectors, and were outstanding on QR flights. My BA Executive Club Gold/OneWorld Emerald card gained me access to AA Admiral's Club lounges in DCA and PHL. QR used the AF-KLM Lounge in ORD, QR's own Al Mourjan Lounge in DOH, and the UL Serendib Lounge in CMB. My overall rating for the entire trip is 8/10, broken-down as follows: AA = 7/10, QR = 9/10 and UL = 8/10. I would fly all three OneWorld airlines again, and recommend them based on this trip experience."
   Delayed flight and express baggage transfer Delayed due to weather led to a late departure giving a really tight transfer at Minneapolis for onwards flight to Amsterdam and connecting to Bristol. They had about 35 minutes to make my onward flight and luckily that was not an issue. Did not expect my checked bag to make it and geared up for a late delivery once I got back to the UK. To give all at Minneapolis full credit that checked bag arrived at AMS and finally at Bristol. A job well done.
"   Delta Air Lines flight dreadful in every way. The all-economy-class CRJ200 should have been long retired. DL's (and other US carriers') continued use of this extremely uncomfortable relic on routes well over an hour long boggles the mind. The gate agent did not thank me in any way for being a gold elite frequent flyer in DL's program, and did not smile (the least she could do, given that there's no first class to upgrade into). My exit row seat (8D) had less legroom than regular non-exit rows on mainline aircraft. Extremely bumpy flight throughout. Bathroom at the back of the aircraft is incredibly tiny. My feet were freezing by the end of the one and a half hour long flight, because of the very cold airflow by the floor in the exit row (not sure if this was a specific issue with this particular A/C, or a problem with the CRJ200 in general). The pricing on this route does not make any sense (I paid as much for a coach one-way Detroit-Greensboro in coach as I do for roundtrip nonstops Detroit - Las Vegas in first class), lack of competition or high demand, perhaps. Take every effort you can to avoid DL on this route and the CRJ200 in general."
"   Delta Air Lines flight from Paris to Newark was smooth and pleasant. Efficient boarding, take off on time. Very good food: both meals and ice cream and bottle of water in between. FAs were swift and attentive. IFE with a very broad selection of movies/programs. The only downside was a quite old aircraft with all related issues (loose panels, exposed repaired details, drafts in the cabin), but the seat (economy) was surprisingly comfortable. I think Delta would gain many more credits with a newer fleet on the long range flights. In general very good impression. With 2 points subtracted for the aircraft cabin condition, I definitely recommend Delta for trans-atlantic travel."
"   Delta Air Lines from New York JFK to Honolulu. Perfect from start to finish. International lie flat seat, good food, excellent entertainment but mostly a warm and efficient staff. Flights to Hawaii are often on old aircraft with bad food and crabby attendants. This flight was a joy. I hope this seasonal service is extended to year round. Delta really gets this one right."
"   Delta allowed me to change our destination due to Hurricane Irma free of charge, on the day of the flight. I see this as an extraordinarily positive gesture. Airplanes quite new, service reasonable. On national flights weaker refreshments. Overall good price-value ratio."
   Delta continues to be the best of the American legacy airlines. Check-in at Barcelona was easy and the gentleman who printed our boarding passes and took our baggage was very personable and made us feel very welcome. Business class seating was fine and service was efficient and pleasant. IFE was fine and I was able to watch two current movies during my flight. Food was fine and water and beverages available throughout the flight. Overall the flight was a pleasant experience.
"   Delta flight left Billings, MT late. Connecting flight to Houston would not wait even until departure time for group of about 8 people who made it to the gate by running completely across the airport and managed to make it as much as 8 min prior to departure. Wanted to fly me all night thru two addition airports to get me to my destination midmorning the following day. The best they were willing to do when I refused was put me in a room tonight to get to Houston on a late morning flight. Chose to return to Billings and have to rebook at my expense to try again later this week. Clerk gave me a ticket and said I'd get there at 11 something. Got to that gate and checked status so I could give my husband the right time and found this flight also delayed. Est time of arrival is now 1.20am. I paid for you to waste my day today, but never again, Delta. I wish Southwest would add Billings to their destinations."
"   Delta is always an excellent experience I flew from New York JFK to Boston and found the flight crew nice and friendly. Even on a short flight the attention you get from the flight attendants was excellent. Seats were nice and comfortable, enough legroom and space. Ground crew were helpful. I have flown with many airlines and I still think Delta is one of the best."
"   Delta is good for a US airline, but US airlines in general are not very impressive. I do prefer Delta to other US airlines, however. Flew Detroit to Shanghai. The leather seats are pretty nice, as they feel less dirty than the fabric seats can potentially be. The inflight entertainment had a pretty good selection, but the setup of the system was not the most convenient. In the economy cabin, you plug your headphones into the system itself rather than the armrest, thus if you need to let a passenger leave his seat, you have to unplug your headphones for him to do so. The food in economy class was just what you would expect of airplane food, nothing special. When boarding the plane, the cabin was disgustingly heated, as the air conditioning was not working very well on the ground. The air conditioning did work while in the air, however. The jumbo jet was among some of Delta's older aircraft, and Delta is planning to retire the remaining ones in their fleet by the end of next year.
"
"   Delta let us wait for more than seven hours (check in at 12 noon, original departure at 13.50 for flight from Seattle to Amsterdam, now expected - but still not confirmed - for 20.30). The staff are friendly enough but have no clue. Other airlines would long since have brought in a new plane or at least cancelled the flight.

"   Denver to Buffalo. I'm not one who is usually compelled to write a review but the service I experienced this weekend flying on American Airlines was so horrible that I had to. It all began when I believed I left my debit card at the ticketing counter when I paid to check my bag. After exiting security and returning to the check in area, I approached an attendant and kindly asked him if anyone had turned in a debit card as I had lost mine, the guy doesn't even look up from what he is doing and rudely yells ""did anyone turn in a debit card? No?"" Then looks at me and says ""retrace your steps, it's not my problem."" Finally I get past security and to my gate, we board the plane and begin to take off. A passenger gets sick before we even take off so we return to the gate, completely understandable. After waiting for 30 minutes for them to clean up, we are informed that they need to ""wax the plane down"" which took another 45 minutes. It was at this point that the pilot stated that he informed all AA crew we were delayed so we could get to our connecting flights in Charlotte. 45 minutes into the ""waxing"" we were informed we were returning to the gate yet again due to possible damage to the tail. I needed to get to Buffalo that night due to an important engagement early the next day so I decided to exit the plane and attempt to get on another flight that night. The flight attendant rudely stated overhead that anyone exiting the plane would not be welcome back on if they took off soon. My last straw was booking another flight and due to AA already rebooking my Charlotte flight for the next evening, they were refusing to put me on a flight that left that night so I had to repurchase another ticket with the ""possibility of a refund"" which was eventually denied. Everyone from the checkin counter to the flight attendants and gate staff were awful. I don't even think they know what being polite or a smile is. On top of it, my bags were lost and I received them the day I returned back to Denver. I paid for extra seating and another ticket and they still will not refund me. Never flying this airline again. It blows my mind they can still operate."
"   Denver to Chicago. I this the attendants and CPU yet staff are just as nice as any other airline. I think the problems I encountered are higher up their food chain. Flying Den to Chi, delayed an hour. Two days later, return flight we waited over two hours for a crew member. I've had more delays than on time flight with American, so plan ahead to be comfortable, because you never know if you'll leave on time or have to sit around and wait for them to get their poop in a group!"
"   Denver to Dallas Ft Worth. Boarding the plane- the ladies checking boarding passes were extremely rude to passengers. The pilot just about took us out trying to get down the JetWay to the plane. The manager was rude when coming through jetway to get checked carry on luggage down. There are ways to say ""excuse me"" if you are trying to get by. Stewardess was rude on the flight as well. What happened to hospitality, kindness, and manners in this place?"
"   Denver to Lihue via Los Angeles. Awful company. If you book two tickets, what makes these people think you want to sit 20 aisles apart? In all honesty, please give me a valid response on why this company thinks it is okay to hold such practices? If you want to sit with your spouse, make sure you decide to spend the extra $140 to $200 to get ""select"" seating on a flight that already cost you nearly $1000 a ticket just to get a seat. By the way, seats are stiff, food is junk, in flight entertainment is probably what they spend your money on (for longer 2+ hour flights) and in flight WiFi is a joke. I'll be sure to never fly this company again."
"   Denver to London return via Detroit outbound, and Minneapolis on return. Delta provided punctual flights, comfortable seats, acceptable food, and good cabin service. This review pertains only to the Detroit to London return flights. Delta Comfort seats had excellent legroom (I'm 6'3"") and width (weight 160) and cushioning. We sat in seats 17A/B both routes. In-flight entertainment was OK, but I prefer to watch iPad or do crosswords. Sleep was possible with the recline and own neck pillow, but it was fitful because I dislike sleeping sitting up. Cabin service impressed me. We received two meals, a snack, and at least three beverage rounds (drinks, coffee/tea, juice). Cabin crew were attentive and conscientious. We have flown British Airways and American Airlines internationally on this same route previously and were not impressed. Delta wins. I might add that the Detroit airport was great. We landed about 8:30pm and our flight departed 10pm. Very few people were in the terminal, but most shops were open for water, snacks, etc. It's a modern place."
"   Denver to Manchester via New York JFK. Delta offer no lounge facility at Denver and nor do they offer any vouchers or other compensation for this - Not good enough. The airline brags a lot about its ability to stick to schedule and pulls one or two tricks to achieve this. We pulled back from the gate within a couple of minutes of schedule but then sat around for an age prior to taxiing. On time departure is calculated from pull back from gate, even if you go only a few feet. Service on board both sectors was excellent with very pleasant and efficient crew. Food offerings on both flights were very good and beverages were frequently offered. Denver to JFK was a midday flight and JFK to Manchester an overnight. Service on both flights was excellent. The lounge at JFK was welcoming and had a variety of hot and cold food on offer. Having eaten on the plane we did not bother with the offerings in the lounge. There is a complimentary bar service (you pay for premium and imported) with a good range of beverages supplemented by tea/coffee machines. The flat bed on both sectors was comfortable, IFE has a small selection compared to many airlines, not a problem for the overnight flight as I slept most of the trip. Bags were on the belt quickly in Manchester. Overall a good experience but Delta need to get lounge access at Denver."
"   Denver to Norfolk. I used to love American Airlines. The planes are comfortable and normally the service is great. Plus, they take care of their Active Duty military, such as myself, but the last time that i flew, I had a lock on my bag get cut off, and had my PS4 pro, controller, and power cord get stolen. Ive flown my PS4 before many times with no problems. No one has ever cut the lock to get to the items."
"   Denver to Quito via Dallas/Ft. Worth. So we planned an awesome trip to the Galapagos and made the mistake of purchasing plane tickets to Quito Ecuador on American Airlines. I made the horrible mistake of screwing the time up and arriving at the Denver airport with only 45 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave. When we got to the ticket counter the American Airlines (AA) ticket agent told us that they closed acceptance for luggage 5 minutes ago, so they don't let us on our flight because of 5 minutes! This is where we really got shafted because we asked them to find us another flight to get to Quito and they did, but they gouged us for an extra $2500, which was $1500 more than the original cost of the tickets, we were furious, but with all the other reservations and time taken off work what could we do but let them take advantage of us, so we paid. The ironic rub to that flying out experience was the return flight from Quito, which AA delayed over 3 hours and only gave the excuse that it was ""legal"" issues. When I complained to them in an email they admitted that they didn't plan well enough in this computer age for a flight that had been scheduled for months to be able to have pilots that were rested enough to make that flight according to the FAA, so they held the flight until the pilots were legally rested. So this corporate giant wouldn't hold our outgoing flight 5 minutes so they could load our luggage, but they didn't mind messing up every passengers connecting flights on our return flight because of their own lazy planning. I'm never flying on AA again and if you can avoid it you shouldn't either."
"   Denver to Sioux Falls. Not only are chances likely that you'll have a delay (4 of my last 4 flights with them), passengers weren't notified of the delay until after we boarded this morning and 15 minutes into boarding for the second flight. I have literally been sitting at the airport for 12 hours because of a missed connection that I could have left the airport and driven 9 hours to my destination. Had I been notified ahead of time of these delays, I could have driven across the Midwest to get to my destination and not missed the prayer service for my uncle who passed away. Based on my last four experiences, they have surpassed Frontier from an unreliable standpoint. I will never fly with them again."
"   Denver to Washington via Charlotte. I arrived into Denver on a United Flight. Spent time in the United Club West, then the Delta Club in Term A, as I prefer the Delta Club in Denver vs. the Admirals Club. Some drinks and light snacks then it was time to board. A321 being used for this 2hr 39 min flight to Charlotte, first class was full and economy was about 2/3rds full. Welcomed onboard by the 2 flight attendants servicing first class. A pre departure beverage followed by what turned out to be a 1 hour delay due to a maint issue in the cargo hold. Updates from the cockpit every 10 minutes, additional beverages offered and everyone was allowed to use their phones and the restrooms during the delay. Off the gate 1 hr late, a 15 minute taxi and we were airborne. A round of drinks with American's signature warm nuts were offered, followed by Lunch, with a very tasty appetiser, for the main I choose pasta, with a fresh side salad. Warm Rolls were offered, followed by an excellent Cheese Cake with caramel topping dessert. Drinks continued until decent. A fairly quick arrival and we arrived at the gate only 16 minutes late. Stayed in the Admirals Club in CLT, Term B for 90 minutes then boarded a B738 to DCA. This time in Main Cabin Extra. Good Legroom with a standard economy class seat. Full flight tonight, 59 minutes in the air, a quick, but full beverage service. I was on the ground and at my DCA hotel before our scheduled arrival time. Overall a nice lunch service on the first segment and a quick and professional crew served the economy section, on the second segment. Nice job American Airlines."
"   Detroit to Dallas via Los Angeles. My buddy and I flew on AA from Detroit to Los Angeles had 2 carry ons, but one of flight attendants ask to take my other carry on bag with her due to overcrowding situation, she said don’t worry about it that I will get my bag at my final destination. So we reached to LAXand got my checked bag and I noticed that the front pouch was totally ripped. We spoke to AA workers at desk, and found out that I was given someone else's bag tag, not mine. AA workers say that my bag was in another location and it will be returned in a few days. I finally got my bag in 3 days. This was not a good experience with AA on my part, next time I will travel with a different airline that will be more cautious and efficient with handling passengers personal items and luggage! Unsatisfied customer."
"   Detroit to Nashville via Philadelphia. This is the second time in one week that I have had an issue with this airline. Not only do they think it’s ok for a plane to arrive later than scheduled when it says “on time”, they don’t care that they are ruining people’s schedules. I asked for at least a courtesy voucher and they said no, because they don’t feel it’s their fault. Well if you sit on an American Airlines plane for over an hour and you are in your destination City, whose fault is it? These flights costs to much for inconsistencies. The attitudes of the gate attendants are rude and they think they could speak to you any kind of way. This airline needs better manners, better schedules, better prices, and no more inconsistencies."
"   Detroit to New York. This was my first experience and it was not great. American’s online boarding pass links did not work, so I had to get agents to print them at my layover city. My flight home was cancelled and no voucher was offered. When I arrived in Charlotte there was no agent at my gate to help me, so I had to find another agent at another gate. That was after the kiosk computer could not find my flight information. Bad customer service."
"   Detroit to Washington Dulles. Very disappointed in Delta Air Lines  and will be canceling delta credit card. We were delayed multiple times by weather related incident to then be told we would be flying when the plane arrives to then be told the flight was canceld as we waited until 1:30 to be told. Waiting around for nothing when we could have been told earlier and either went home or got a hotel and rebooked. Why wait until 1:30am. No compensation or credit or hotel to stay in nothing. Things happen, but to not be taken care of for nothing is a little absurd. Statistics show that if you stayed at a hotel and had an ok experience you would most likely not stay at that hotel. If you had a bad experience, but the staff took care of and made that experience right you would go back at a much higher rate. If only Delta would have done the smallest thing I would def use them again. I will now try and never use them if I have the chance. Thanks Delta, hello Southwest"
"   DL1598, Dec 25 I was traveling for the holidays with my husband from Seattle to Atlanta and we were in row 14 seats A&B. I started to not feel well from a cold and I had asked the steward if I may please have a tissue or napkin. He promptly replied that there were tissues in the bathroom. I said, Sir I know but I don't want to have to wake the women sleeping next to me and I really didn't feel well enough to get up and walk around at the moment. He repeated his statement about the tissues in the bathroom and walked away. This was the general attitude if we requested other things such as headphones we offered to buy for $2 (which they said was the price) but they never came back. My family has worked for Delta for 20 years and I have always favored this airline but as a paying customer traveling with my family this year this was a flight that certainly lacked respect and customer service which was incredibly disappointing."
"   Dublin to New York. Best airline I have used. Me and my friend got lost in Dublin airort and missed the flight - two persons from Delta was looking for us everywere but it was too late. Can't find right words to express our disappointment. However, we were ofered another flight to Amsterdam, then to New York. The staff was incredibly nice and polite. We didn't had to pay another flight. On the flight with blankets, free drinks and delicious food. Movies and music. And really very nice and friendly staff. "
"   Dublin to Seattle via Boston. Amazing service from this flight. The crew were exceptional. There was a man that needed medical attention in the back of the plane and the crew asked overhead if any nurses or doctors could come back. I am an critical care nurse in Seattle, so both me and my sister (also a nurse in Seattle) went back to help. We spent about 15 minutes back there with the man (who turned out okay), but they took our seat numbers in case he needed any more medical attention. Later on in the flight, a flight attendant came by to take our name, email address and home address so that they could give us each a $100 voucher for our services. I was so touched. Delta was kind enough to not only express their gratitude but to give us a reward. Delta was already one of my favorite airlines because of the quality of the flights as well as the entertainment selection, but now they truly are my favorite airline. "
"   Due to fly from Orlando to LaGuardia. Terrible. Got to the airport 2 hrs in advance. As soon as I get there the flight has been delayed from 8.15am to 9.15am. I wait an hour and the flight attendant comes out and says ""remember everyone the flight is not departing at 9.15am!"" It's will be departing when the maintainence is done, which will be around 10.30am. We are not departing at 10.30am. Now I'm stuck here with no complimentary snacks or drinks for this over 2 hr wait."
"   Due to fly from Philadelphia to Orlando. Horrible, horrible. We were supposed to land in Orlando for 8.59, instead we were in Tampa. That's okay because of a problem in Orlando, but to give out water and no food vouchers with no idea of what time our families will eat. May I add my luggage is still on the plane and I have to wait to take my meds. I will never take American Airlines again."
"   Dulles to Tulsa via Dallas Ft Worth. I scheduled my flight allowing for a 2 hour layover since Dallas airport is known for delays. My flight from Dulles was delayed 45 minutes due to a circuit board issue. Once we finally arrived at Dallas, we had to wait around 30 minutes on the runway because there was a plane at our terminal. Once we finally got off the plane I had 10 minutes to get to my next flight so the stewardess directed me to an AA desk to get another flight. The desk of 3 American Airlines worker had no one at their gate or desk so the stewardess left me their for the 3 girls to help me. The 3 workers never looked up from their desk, and when I finally got them to acknowledge me they said they couldn’t help me because they were busy preparing for an international flight that left in 5 hours! I asked them to at least see if my flight had done last call. They refused saying “we don’t have all the time in the world to help people that aren’t on this flight”. Again, that flight didn’t leave for 5 hours and there were 3 workers! I finally made it down to my gate and spoke with customer assistance. The 3 workers there were all on their cell phones, which they didn’t put down when I arrived for help. I explain the situation and also told them I was shocked by the lack of customer service I received at the other desk. 2 of the workers giggles and rolled their eyes while on their cell phones. The gentleman helping respond, “there are more customer that missed their flight than just you, those workers have to managed many customer with specific need, this desk has all the time in the world though. I have you on a new flight, have a nice day”. I’m happy the gentleman was more “welcoming” than the other 5 customer service workers but I can honestly say this is the worst airline customer service I have experienced from any airline company. In addition, the delays were extremely annoying when you had planned ahead as to avoid the problem of a missed connection. Unless I have to fly AA again, I will not!"
"   Durango to Minneapolis via Chicago. This airline is so unprofessional. My first flight got delayed so an agent rebooked me three flights instead of two like I had originally paid for. All of the flights never departed on time making me nearly miss both connecting flights. American Airlines is so untimely. Instead of a seven hour trip home, it became thirteen hours with all the delays. Despite passengers being being seated for a long time. I will never again fly with this airline for how unprofessional and inconsiderate they are to their customers. I paid more for my flights through this airline than I do at cheaper airlines, like Spirit and Southwest. Spirit and Southwest gave me 100% better service. Please spare yourself a waste of time and money by not flying with American Airlines."
"   Early flight from San Diego to Detroit was full. Flight departed a few minutes late but arrived early into DTW. Flight crew were friendly and came around frequently to sell food and beverages, although in this instance I didn't purchase anything. Plane was clean and the AVOD system was new with a wide range of movies. The seat offered plenty room even for economy. Only thing I can't understand, is that why after boarding the premium and loyalty passengers, they choose to go from front to back."
"   Edmonton to Seattle. The flight was delayed for 5 hours. That was the worst part. We were promptly notified that there was a technical issue with the plane and that there would initially be a 30 minute delay. After 30 minutes we had to deplane. The flight crew was professional and extremely helpful. As soon as we got off the plane they were already distributing snacks, drinks, coloring books for the kids, and also some playing cards. Throughout the ordeal the station attendants were helpful, even when passenger tensions were rising, they remained professional. They even helped some passengers with connecting flights and got them on another flight. After the delay the flight crew were amazing. The pilots got out of the cockpit and addressed everyone face-to-face and apologized for the long delay, which to me showed a high sense of professionalism. The free alcoholic drinks in premium economy were excellent. The snacks were suffice for a short 60 minute flight, just some cookies and pretzels. The seats were highly comfortable and had excellent recline as well. There was no seatback entertainment, however, there were magazines provided. I highly recommend flying on Delta, they know how to treat their customers well."
   Eight flights in last ten days with American. All OK basic average. Then arrived in San Diego missing one very important bag. American staff at the baggage handling area were neither good or bad and they advised me the bag would arrive next morning at 10:30. American Airlines employ a contractor or perhaps it's two contractors to handle late baggage delivery. My experience of this is that information available on whereabouts of your bag/s is very hard to obtain. The information on the delivery contractor/s website is wrong and not updated. Call handling by American Airlines is utterly appalling and amateurish. Call handling agents do not have required information easily to hand and that indicates American Airlines have a garbage infrastructure. After several phone calls one AA call handler kindly let me know the name of the delivery contractor and I was able to finally find out where my bag was and coordinate delivery directly with the contractor. I am shocked and a bit angry to note just how useless AA have been in fixing this not uncommon problem. 
"   El Paso to Chicago. Due to my claustrophobic issues, this was my first flight since 2010. Arriving from Chicago to El Paso the flight was decent because i had the air vent full blast which helped from feeling anxiety; but returning home was a emotional disaster. I paid $90 for me and my husband for leg room and just to find that the only seats available in the main cabin had a low overhead, the air vent had hardly any pressure, tight seat belts, and I was continually bumped every time stewardess pass. After everyone boarded and a few minutes afterwards, the captain announced there was engine problem and there would be a delay. Immediately I began to panic because I couldn't get the air vent to work. I informed the stewardess several times with tears steaming down my face, that I was freaking out and I needed air, and she informs me that once the plane took off, I would get more air. After waiting 30 long minutes on the runway, the plane finally took off and a guy sitting next row saw the panic and my knees shaking, he attempted to help with the air vent. There were four empty seats in front of me and not once did either cabin staff attempt to accommodate nor ask me why I was crying.  Meantime my husband tried to fix the air vent but to no avail. Also the low overhead was so inconvenient and with me crying, he tried to fan me with a magazine, so I know he was miserable as well.  Next time i will spend the extra $100 bucks or more and fly with another airline."
"   Excellent flight from Miami to New York JFK, everything went off without a hitch, the way it should be. Premium check in was fast and efficient. Flight boarded and left on time. This particular 757 is equipped with lie flat international style seats; they were super comfortable and were easy to use. Pre-flight drink served, dinner pre-ordered of chicken and couscous was ready, it was tasty although the chicken could be a little more tender, warm cookie is already a nice touch. FA was kind and congenial and offered to top up our glasses multiple times. The only disappointment was the flight was only 2 hours and 30 minutes, so I only could enjoy the lie flat bed for about and hour and 15 minutes. American has a great first class product."
"   Excellent flight from Rome to New York on Delta Air Lines. Check in at Rome was fast and efficient. The Business Class seat was extremely comfortable. The cabin staff and service was excellent, friendly and polite. The IFE had several choices between music, movies, ant TV. The inflight meals and beverages were outstanding with ample choices. This was an excellent experience with Delta and I will be happy to fly with them again in the future."
"   Excellent service flying Delta domestic first class from Minneapolis to Omaha and flight landed early. Comfortable newer seats with the snappy red lined blue leather seats. Plenty of overhead space for my luggage. I am mid or top tier on three airlines in the US and travel multiples times a week for both business and leisure, so I feel I have a reasonable context from which to rate each experience."
"   Excellent service from ground staff. They use your name when scanning your boarding pass and I noticed they used everyone's surnames. Pretty impressive. Onboard flight attendants warm and cheerful. All flight attendants greeted me including those preparing the galley. Seat was a lie-flat with a Westin pillow and duvet, each individually wrapped. Great selection of movies, TV shows, games and music. Slept for most of the trip but woke for the landing service. Had beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes. Delicious! They also had laksa noodles which smelled good as well. Bathrooms clean and I like the blue LED mood lighting inside. Way to go Delta! The best international service from a US carrier so far."
"   Excellent transcon on DL1290 from Atlanta to San Francisco in first class on a refurbished B757. Flight departed on time and arrived about 10 minutes late. Weather was forecast to be turbulent but pilot altered course and altitude to provide a smooth ride. First class flight attendant was first class. Friendly, energetic, and a pleasure to fly with. Service was fast, food was decent, and glasses were refilled. Noticed that wine is now served from a full bottle, which is a nice upgrade. The B757, while an oldie, had a completely new cabin with in-seat power, personal TV screen, and wifi. The wifi didn't work well on all four segments of my trip. Not sure if it is Delta's receivers, traffic load, or the fact that Gogo doesn't support their connection app anymore, but it took over 45 minutes to connect on each flight. (Gogo was great on Virgin America the week before). Fast gate arrival and my baggage was on the carousel at SFO before I made it to the arrivals level. Baggage was priority tagged and handled accordingly, except they ripped off my luggage ID tag. From chocks down to exiting the SFO parking garage was 5 minutes tops. Delta continues to be my first choice for long hauls from SFO, even though a connection is usually required."
"   Extremely unhappy with Delta. I had a so-so experience during a flight to Little Rock on a Delta partner a few years ago. This time around we flew into DCA. Upon departing D.C., we were delayed by inclement weather to a connection in Atlanta. Even though we selected an alternative flight upon self check-in, we received passes for the cancelled flight. Going to customer service was futile, the desk clerk literally told her supervisor she would not handle delayed flight cases. We got rebooked to a connection in Minneapolis, which Delta also cancelled. It took a further 2 hours waiting in a customer service line to get a solution. The customer service personnel proved absolutely useless, actually handing us a card to their 800 line because they were overwhelmed. The call also proved frustrating, it was only after thirty minutes of being put on hold and talking to an agent that we managed to get a connection to JFK the following morning. On other notes, Delta doesn't offer a free checked bag like many airlines. To check one bag is $25. The food on the flight to LAX was overpriced generic junk, think $12 for a wrap you could have bought for $5 at 7-11."
"   Fayetteville to Minneapolis. Being disabled with a broken ankle, I was dreading my flight to Minneapolis. At the gate I was pleased to be helped so efficiently and pleasantly by a personable lady attendant. Upon boarding the aircraft, we were met by a steward  who made us feel very welcomed and was so helpful. During the flight, he and a stewardess went over and above to make my grandson (age 7) and I have a delightful trip. The plane was beautiful- very clean and well maintained. The captain was great about keeping us informed and the flight was on time and smooth! Thank you so much for such a pleasant surprise trip!"
"   Fayetteville to San Diego via Charlotte. First got a call saying my second flight to San Diego was overbooked then got to the airport to find out the aircraft was downgraded for my first flight so they had to cut 15 people. Then the first flight was delayed for an hour. Not to mention my wife got a call for her flight at 1000 pm the night before saying her flight to a different location was totally cancelled, I have never had a good experience with them only use them rarely when my business makes me use them."
"   Fayetteville to Stuttgart via Atlanta. I have used Delta Air Lines on countless occasion, flying over 100,000 miles on military orders easy. This may be the last time. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to make me care enough to write a review. The service from the flight attendants is typically very attentive and they do what they can to accommodate you. The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music etc. (when the screens are actually operational) and the seats are not unbearable. My issue is with the airlines lack of accommodation when they have a failure to notify the individual that their flight was cancelled and lack of ability to rebook a flight that is equivalent to the one that was paid for. By missing my flight and not being able to reach the deadlines that are required makes me look unprofessional and weighs heavy on my position. This flight definitely put a bad taste in my mouth in regards to Delta Air Lines, unfortunately there was not any attempt to reconcile the issue."
   First time with American Airlines my checked baggage came back broken. Second flight I found chewing gum attached underneath. I told the flight attendant who didn’t care. The fourth time (surely my last time with American Airlines) from New Orleans to Miami my baggage still left in New Orleans and I have to wait for 8 days until I got my baggage back.
"   Flew American Airlines from Belize to Manchester via Los Angeles. Flight late, so missed connecting flight. Lost my luggage, unbelievably rude Baggage Claim. I had to locate bag 4 days later, no contact. No food on 5 hour US flight, awful meal on transatlantic flight. Charge for checked in luggage. Grudging rude staff. Full on prices, pared down service and facilities. Very expensive low budget standard airline. No entertainment on 5 hour flight unless have own device on which app may or may not load. In any event has to be done before you fly. Avoid."
"   Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow in C on a B777-300. Arrived from a domestic flight and transfer in DFW hassle-free, but involved an (easy) change of terminals. DFW is probably one the very best transfer airports in the U.S. AAdmirals Club in DFW was nicer than others I have been to, but offerings very minimal and sub-par for an international flight. Food and ""premium"" drinks for purchase at steep airport prices. Coffee/tea, soft drinks for free. Basic beer and wine available from a manned bar (this is the U.S., so ""free"" means ""for tips""). WIFI was reliable. Overall, definitely not comparable to the lounge experience offered by non U.S.-based airlines. Boarding fairly orderly and cabin crew good and friendly. Seats in C are in a herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. Same seats as CX and these are one of the best seats in C for space and comfort. IFE was AVOD, selection good, Bose headphones supplied, screen not very responsive, but visually good. However, irritating ads before every selection, that could not be skipped or fast forwarded. Dinner (chose the quinoa crusted prawns) was actually tasty on this flight and quality in line what I would expect in transatlantic business class. It was a night flight, so tray service, but service did not feel rushed just to get it over with. Drinks selection good as well and with regular top ups. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was a good choice. Slept thru breakfast, so cannot comment on it, but FA’s offered to bring some coffee just before landing, which was much appreciated. Catering out of AA’s hub in DFW seems to be superior to that out of other locations. Cabin crew professional, obviously experienced and good, even friendly. On-time departure and on time arrival (more or less). Good experience and nothing to complain about. Comparing to other carriers I have used in C over the Atlantic: as for Oneworld alternatives AA is way ahead of BA (especially due to seating arrangement on AA’s B777-300 vs. BA’s high density 2-4-2 seating), probably in line with AY, but not quite on the level of IB. Also, I would rate the overall experience on Star Alliance’s OS and LX higher, but again AA did good on this flight. Recommended, if you are on B777-300 (seating can be much inferior on other planes types)."
   Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth to Philadelphia. My family and I have never had such poor service until today. The flight attendants were so rude and disrespectful. They were serving other passengers and were talking to all passengers rudely. I asked for my complimentary cookie and they both acted as though we were stealing from them. Then I asked for coffee and she asked the other attendant - 'what does she want' in a ugly manner. Then she slammed the sugar on the tray. I cannot believe attendants are able to treat people this way. If you don't like your job then quit and allow someone else to be happy at what they do.
"   Flew American Airlines from Denver to Liberia via Miami. I had eight people on a flight for my wedding to Costa Rica through Miami. They boarded the plane 15 minutes early (of course we were delayed taking off for 45 minutes) so when we arrived at the designated boarding time the agent informs us our carry on bags will have to be checked. When I say that's fine but ask if anything can be done about the wedding dress she immediately becomes rude saying we should have been there on time. Apparently we should have known they were boarding early. She demands the boarding passes if we want to make the flight at all. As I am trying to get all 8 separated from the connecting flight boarding passes she threatens to keep me off the plane ""if I throw one more boarding pass at her"". I was sliding them off the stack of paper I was holding onto the counter. None touched her or even went to the edge. She comes around the counter to tag our bags telling me I would have had to check mine anyway. I responded that I've never had any problem with it as a carry on in 5 years with numerous airlines. She pointed to the expander zippers being opened as her rationale. I took the boarding passes from her and she said that she could keep me off the plane until I cooled down and that she was going to tell the pilot about me. I did not raise my voice, curse, or even argue at any point throughout this encounter. I said nothing and boarded the flight as I needed to get to my wedding. Once onboard there were at least 5 overhead compartments with room for the dress. Begging the flight attendants did absolutely nothing and they closed the half full compartments. After talking to several other people apparently we were no the only people treated poorly by the desk agent. However, repeated attempts to file a complaint with American have resulted in nothing more than a complete brush off."
   Flew American Airlines from Miami to Atlanta. When boarding the plane the lady checking my bag said she wanted me to check and see if it would fit and if not I would have to check it. I was able to fit it in and she rudely told me I still had to check it even after me telling her I was going to miss my shuttle from Atlanta to Chattanooga. I also told her I was pregnant and really needed to make the shuttle. I had no trouble on the way there and didn't purchase anything this trip so the bag size did not change. Customer service was absolutely horrible. I've never felt so disrespected while traveling. No wonder they have had such horrible reviews lately. They need to work on their employee training so that customers are treated with respect.
"   Flew American Airlines from New Delhi to Baltimore via Atlanta. Staff are rude. Food below expectation. Seat selection Nil. Utterly bad experience. Rudely asked at Atlanta if I was really seated in a Business class seat by airline staff. They had chosen me the Hindu meal without my consent. No choice, no change, so had to consume what was thrown at me."
"   Flew American Airlines from Ontario to Phoenix. I had to call the customer service for a question about baggage and upgrade. I would like to say how impressed I was with their customer service. Upon completing a short voice prompt, I was directed to the appropriate department. I expected a wait time as with most lines. I was pleasantly surprised to be connected to a customer service representative in under a minute. When I talked to her, she was most gracious and helpful."
   Flew American Airlines from Phoenix to Chicago. I was shocked upon getting to my seat. There was two partially wet napkins scattered on the seat with tons of crumbs and flakes. The women who was already seated said hers was like that as well and she pointed it out to stewardess and she said she was not concerned about it at all and just threw the napkins on my seat and said the person could just clean it up. What grossed me out the most was I never knew if the wet stuff was from the napkin or was on the seat from the previous passenger. You never know what it could be. I was shocked the stewardess was rude to the other passenger and seemed bothered she had to go get napkins. I fly a lot and never have had my seat so gross.
"   Flew American Airlines from Salt Lake City to Chicago. After waiting for over thirty minutes after our flight was supposed to take off we found out that there was no crew for our flight. They then said that they were working on finding one. After two and a half hours they decided that our flight was then cancelled. We then had to wait to rebook and dealt with a very incompetent front desk lady. After it took her 45 minutes to rebook us we had to find a hotel, the airline didn't even offer to pay for it even though it was their fault our flight was cancelled. After a short night in a hotel we had to go back to the airport to catch our new flight. We had been told that we would all be sitting next to each other and that there wouldn't be any delays in our flights. We were mistaken. Once we landed in Phoenix we waited three hours before we even boarded our plane, this was after they did a last minute gate change. Even after we had to wait three hours for our flight, we had to sit on a hot plane for an hour and a half before it even took off. We had been told we would land in Chicago by 2 pm. We didn't arrive until 5.30pm. With myself being pregnant all of these changes, delays, and cancelations were very hard on my body. Not only did we have to pay for a hotel but we had to pay for an extra day on our long term parking. When I emailed this airline, they apologized and said that there wasn't anything they do with cancellations or delays. My husband and I have flown a lot. This was our first flight with American Airlines and it was terrible. Go with another airline when you find your self booking. "
"   Flew American Airlines from Seattle to Boston via New York. Awful experience - 3 hour delay, missed connecting flight, rebooked on a flight 4 hours later. Customer service agent was too busy involving herself in everyone else's issues while she was ""helping"" me that by the time she found a different, earlier flight out of a nearby airport we wouldn't have enough time to make it. Then they booked me in the last boarding group in my flight. There were plenty of open seats in business class - those were never offered. All around horrible experience, I don't ever plan to fly American again."
"   Flew American Airlines from Tampa to Dallas. On-time direct round-trip flights on clean aircraft. Paid for extra legroom and earlier boarding, light hand baggage only. Human contact with AA staff was limited to boarding at the gate and trolley service on the DFW-TPA sector, but all were courteous and motivated. A 21st century flying experience with no bother."
"   Flew American Airlines in MCE from Austin to Las Vegas via Los Angeles. First flight on a new A321, bulkhead. Comfortable seat with plenty of legroom despite a fixed wall in front. Nice video screen with plenty of option to pass on the time on a quick 3 hour flight. Flight attendants this morning were ever present and filled out several drink orders with a smile and some humor. Did not purchase any food, as we had a light breakfast in the Admirals Club before boarding. Flight was comfortable enough and on time, thankfully as we had only a 45 minute connection in LAX. Connection to LAS was on a B738. The gate area was chaotic, however boarding was on time and efficient. 2nd row in MCE had plenty of legroom for he 46 minute flight to LAS. A quick beverage service with only a choice of juice or water was just fine. On time again, with decent service for a very busy short short hop. Overall pleased as usual and good value."
"   Flew Atlanta to Cincinnati with Delta. There was only one lady working at the desk when there was a line of over 50 people even though there were two other computers available, which delayed the flight by at least 30 minutes. By the time everyone got on board there was a weather warning so each flight was delayed. Finally once the plane had been cleared for take off our plane was number 25 in line for take off. Absolutely horrible service. If the flight staff were aware there would be a delay they shouldn't have boarded everyone an hour and 15 minutes before the plane would even take off. So disappointed."
   Flew Buffalo to New York City. I understand that you get what you pay for and that is exactly what happened here and every time I've flown with Delta Air Lines. I have not had one smooth flight or flight on time. First flight went out 20 minutes past departure and the return flight was almost 2 hours delayed. This is unacceptable. I could have driven with less headaches. 
   Flew Charlotte NC to Fayetteville NC. Trash. I fly American all the time due to contracting with the company I work for. I can not stand them. Always late. Airplains are always delayed. I have a flight canceled on me 30min befor it boarded. I ended up having to drive over an hour to the next airport to make the flight they transferred me to without offering me a refund or if it was possible for me to make it that far. Every time I fly I with American I know I am flying the absolute bottom of the barrel. Oh and they live to charge like they are something special. $1000+ for a round trip on the east coast? Wish I was back with Southwest. 
"   Flew Chicago to Syracuse. Another disaster of American Airlines customer service. I get to the terminal 3 hours early and there is an earlier flight to my destination half full. I cannot even go standby due to my 'status' on American. Watched the half full early flight depart and sat 3 hours to get on the original departure. Don't have these issues with Delta, United etc and they go out of their way to accommodate. If American wants me to obtain status, well this just proves why I stick with Delta."
   Flew Dallas to Seattle with American Airlines. Our flight there was fine. Everything went fine. On the way back the weather was bad. Our flight got cancelled they didn't have another flight for us. So we had to wait another 24 hrs just to get on a flight. Finally got ready to board and the plane had engine issues. So we ended up sitting on the plane for 2 hrs waiting for a new gate to be towed to. We had to wait another hr for another plane. We get on the plane and had to wait another hour for catering and baggage. I had my 3 kids and come to find out they didn't offer any food at this time because it was too late - we had been at the airport since 7.30pm and we did not make it home until 2 am. They didn't even attempt to make up for anything. It was horrible.
"   Flew Delta Air Lines from Atlanta to Toronto. I have been flying for years, never before have I had such a bad experience as this one. Not only did they run out of space to put away my small carry-on luggage but, they also could not reach all their customers with drinks and food. This will probably be the last time I fly with Delta. Having a delayed flight is normal but, with all these other factors that went into the poor flight, this will have to be the last time."
   Flew Delta Air Lines from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Terrible judgement. They had half the plane gate check their bags when there was room in the overhead bins. This cost me 30 minutes on the destination side and caused me to miss my evening plans. Whoever came up with such a short sighted policy or made the decision should be punished. On top of this the seats are tightly spaced my knees heavily abutt the seat in front of me. This airline is very poorly run in my opinion.
   Flew Delta Air Lines from Nashville to Salt Lake City. Flight crew were great. When I arrived late to make my connecting flight the gate attendent told me there was no room. Gave us a $100.00 voucher and said they would supply us with pillows and blankets. We were apparently welcome to sleep anywhere in the airport. $100.00 is compensation really? Apparently if look around there are flat benches. All good works of the flight crew destroyed.
"   Flew Delta Air Lines from Seattle to Atlanta. The telephone service is absolutely terrible. I tried to call reservations multiple times over the past week. I had delays of 40 min to 2+ hours. Most time I could not get through. The space under the seats in the First/Business Class cabin on the B737-900 ER has been severely reduced. I do not know about the economy section. There are 3 black boxes under the seat and a 120 V plug. This makes it impossible to store anything under the seat ahead of an aisle seat. The space has been reduced in the right to left dimension and in the top to bottom dimension. In addition, the Boeing seat struts are poorly designed so that there is little space for the aisle seat under the seat ahead & there is dead useless space. In effect the under-seat space is divided into 3 compartments for the aisle seat. The 1st photo shows from right to left: the bar by the aisle, 1st black box, metal seat strut, 2nd black box. The 2nd photo shows the AC outlets at the top and the 3rd black box next to the other seat strut."
   Flew Delta from Chicago to New York. Seats are assigned at the gate. Multiple staff members present at the gate however staff chose to ignore me standing there. At my second attempt to asked whether I could be seated next to my husband the staff member barely made eye contact with me and did not offer to assist with this query. I witness other people's queries being answered rudely. Extremely unprofessional service for an airline. I will not be flying with this company in future.
   Flew Delta from Seattle to New Orleans via Atlanta. I chose this flight because the aircraft was internationally configured and that made the difference. It was fine but the aircraft interior seemed a bit beat up. The service was domestic of course and ok. Crew was fine. Flight was delayed two hours but assistance rebooking connection was handled well.
"   Flew Detroit to LaGuardia. This is again an example of cattle transport. Delta had old planes. This one really looked like it was ready for the junk yard. Again, at Delta you get nothing. The seats are totally uncomfortable as well. I was happy to land in New York and have this experience behind me."
"   Flew Detroit to Las Vegas with Delta Air Lines. Very uncomfortable. I thought since this was a bigger plane, that the seats would be larger. Nope. The airline staff also skipped over me during the snacks and beverages. This is also the only flight in which I got a terrible headache from the sound of the plane. Lastly, the headrest video/music player did not work well enough to be able to watch or listen to much. Big disappointment."
   Flew Edmonton to San Francisco via Seattle. What a pleasant surprise - a domestic US carrier that is working hard to improve customer service. Check in was efficient and staffed by helpful friendly people. Boarding was equally efficient. The flight attendants worked hard to deliver genuine service and nothing was ever a problem. This was my 5th and 6th flight with Delta Air Lines this year - I have been trying them after consistent issues with AA. Based on this experience I will be using them more often. They seem to be working to lift their game.
"   Flew Frankfurt to Atlanta. Every time I have flown with Delta, I have had problems. Today the plane landed at the terminal on time, but the plane was broken. This 1.5 hour delay made me miss my connecting flight. They came over the announcement and said it was our job to ensure we scheduled our connecting flights when we land because it is out of their control. I have been away from home for 6 months and would like to be able to depend on an airline to get me there."
   Flew from Amsterdam to Boston. Most Delta aircraft are aged but nicely refitted. The IFE is nice but movie selection and variety I have experienced better. In the aircraft's we have flown there were no power sockets. Attendants not the most courteous I have seen. Overall the price was excellent and seats were comfortable so the airline is worth it as partnering with Skyteam offers excellent flight combinations with partners airlines to and from USA.
"   Flew from Amsterdam to Detroit. Oh Delta what has happened to your economy comfort plus product. It used to be worth the upgrade. Now I'm not so sure. Inedible food, I defy anyone to guess what we were offered, pic attached. Reduced beverage trolley service. You used to be treated a bit better, not now. Increased cost reduced service. Trip only saved by decent aircraft and inflight back seat entertainment system.
"
"   Flew from Austin to New York. This is the third time I have had problems with American Airlines. I am done giving them chances. They are constantly delaying and canceling flights and they do a horrible job with accommodations. I strongly advise you to choose a different airline unless you feel like sleeping in the airport waiting for a flight 15 hours later.
"
"   Flew from Denver to Detroit. I've been flying Delta for years but will never again. From the time I initially booked to the 3 hours I've been waiting online because they messed up the tickets for my 2 daughters I am traveling with. It has been one mistake after the next. As I stand in the longest line I have ever seen, I listen to story after story of people that have had similar experiences. What a terrible airline. Never again.

"   Flew from Detroit to New York with American Airlines. I will never fly this airline again. This is the second time in two months in which my flight has been cancelled. Granted this past experience was due to weather, but the rebooking process has been painful and a full day delayed. Good thing I work for a company that is flexible and didn’t need to take a vacation day due to this. The first time it happened, I drove overnight to reach my destination in time - American was useless in even trying to look through other airlines. And when I requested a refund I was told I had to go online and request it. What? I’m on the phone with you after waiting over an hour to speak to a human and you can’t just put something into the computer to apply a refund for a flight I can’t use because of a cancellation outside of my control? Pathetic. This time? Got rebooked for a flight a full day later that was then delayed another 2 hours. Well worth paying an extra $100 to not have to deal with cancellations."
"   Flew from Miami to London Heathrow in First Class. The ground staff were very arrogant not helpful at all, nice layout of the first class cabin, staff on board not professional. We need to set up our cabin for the night by ourself no help from the staff they were eating. Entertainment system was not working at all during the full flight no excuses or explanations, lavatories were empty of courtesy products. Food was a disaster . Will never travel again with AA. Avoid if you can."
   Flew from New Orleans to Cancun. A travel warning was issued to our place of destination after booking the flight. Other members of our group are flying with Delta and I regret not doing so. Everyone was able to change their ticket as Delta was understanding of the circumstances. I was not given that option and could not even escalate the call to speak to someone for assistance. The customer service I received was useless and the lack of concern for safety is completely unacceptable. Never using American Airlines again.
"   Flew from New York LGA to Chicago ORD on a flight that surpassed every expectation! It left and arrived on schedule. I had checked in a bag and it was on the luggage carousel soon after arrival. The in-flight service harkened back to the joyous days of flying. Two exceedingly courteous and solicitous flight attendants catered to the first class cabin whose 16 seats were all occupied. A full breakfast with choices was provided. Beverages were offered numerous times. Attendants came regularly to check on passenger wishes. Free giveaway headphones were offered to listen to music or watch a show on the drop down from the ceiling TV screens - no screens on the back of the seat in front. Bathroom was kept clean and tidy. A hot towel to refresh was another pleasant perk. Pilots kept us in the loop on the flight's progress. It was a very early morning flight on the first day of the month - the July issue of the inflight magazine was in the pocket and the crossword puzzle was quite engaging. The cabin was pleasant, spacious and clean with ample overhead space to stow bags. Very high performance by American Airlines! Hope they can repeat it again and again."
"   Flew from San Diego to Atlanta nonstop and had an overall good experience with Delta. Flight was delayed slightly (less than an hour) after boarding, but the captain was diligent in relaying the delay and reason for delay. Captain also relayed information about storm systems over Texas upon takeoff. Due to the storm, seat belt signs were on for a long time, but this was understandable. I booked online, and my assigned seat only changed when they switched aircraft sizes well before the actual departure date. Crew offered snacks/drinks two or three times during the 4 hour flight. We landed appx. 15 minutes late. I only had a carry-on so I have no knowledge of checked baggage for this particular flight."
"   Flew from St Lucia - O'hare (Connecting flight in ATL). Only flew because the resort had an exclusive with them. Lost bag in ATL in the layover. They finally found it in ATL, and gave me the hours of 8:00am - 8:00pm to be delivered the following day. They would give me a call from an unknown number, but if I didn't answer, they wouldn't deliver it. Since I have a job and don't sit on my phone all day, my other option was for them to leave it at the front porch. I don't know about you, but I don't like my belongings just hanging around the front porch all day, so was I forced to take off work. I found Delta's customer service to be a joke when trying to get compensated for my lost wages. You call into one dept, with no managers, only to be told I have to put a complaint through their website. If you wish to follow up, you'll get the runaround. Once you put a complaint through their website, you'll get an email back from a general email stating, ""We don't offer reimbursement"", but thanks for paying $1500, along with the bag fees and inconvenience we caused you, but please fly again. You are unable to contact anyone via phone. Apparently, their corp center with the employees sending these emails, don't have phones. There's no phone lines to their Corp Center, so they can just hide behind general emails and deny people. 2nd time they lost my luggage. I can't understand why Delta is still even around."
"   Flew from Vancouver to Washington DC via Minneapolis. I'm in shock. Although the A320 on this three hour flight is 18 years old the interior is completely refurbished, including panels and overhead bins. The seats are new and very comfy. Every seat has a power outlet. Even the lavatories are completely refurbished. Then came the meal. Glass glasses. Nicely patterned table cloth. Bamboo looking non-slip trays. Copious amounts of delicious food presented in an elegant way. Great red wine. Wonderful service. Add to that the great onboard free streamed entertainment system titled Online Delta Studio, which you can access on any of your devices, and an internet connection that actually works. I'm so impressed with Delta right now for this is an airline I despised, and rightfully so, for having some of the worse onboard experiences. But if they can maintain this experience and keep it consistent throughout all their flights, I'm ready to convert. An actual 5-star experience on one of the US legacy airlines. Never thought I’d witness the day."
"   Flew Indianapolis to Salt Lake City via Atlanta. Got the ticket at the airport because Frontier cancelled the original flight unexpectedly. First time flying US domestic with Delta Air Lines. Although the service was not as good as the International service with Delta, it was similar to other US airlines. Complementary drinks and snacks such as pretzels and peanuts are provided throughout the trip. The domestic inflight entertainment system is the same as the international IFE. However, headphones are not complementary unlike international routes which is not a big problem if you bring your own. Overall, Delta is a good airline for your travel needs."
"   Flew Las Vegas to Miami. American Airlines is usually one of my last airlines of choice. But in this case, price and schedule left me no choice, so AA it was. While they continue to try to find ways to cram more people on their planes, and seating is definitely tight, in this case, since it was a red eye, I fortunately managed to sleep through the flight despite being not very comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived a little early and I mostly slept through it, so I guess that's a win! The A321 had inflight entertainment provided via ones own device and wifi. I did not attempt to use it. One thing about AA and MIA is there is a very long walk from the terminal to where the baggage claim is and it took maybe 15 more minutes after this walk before luggage arrived. In this case, the price of the flight was good, I got to my destination safely on time, and I slept through the flight. However, I still do not like American and only chose them when I do not have another choice as they are the dominant carrier out of Miami."
"   Flew Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Very nice surprise, aircraft very new, good staff and Wi-Fi. Was surprised with the good service, full flight left gate on time. American Airlines made us feel that the flight was about serving the customer. "
"   Flew Miami to Maui via Phoenix. American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown. Even though flying first class, the gate agent charged me for bags. I complained at the time but was told that is the way it's going to be. The gate agent then sent my bag to a different country leaving me with no clothing, toiletries, etc. Even a day later the airline was unable to confirm the location of my bag or make any commitments regarding getting the bag to me. I had travelled to Maui for my son's wedding. On top of all of this, on two long-haul flights to Maui from Miami, the airplanes had no entertainment and shoddy Internet. To the extent humanly possible, I will never fly American Airlines again."
"   Flew New York, NY to Birmingham, AL. So we had a major unexpected traffic delay while departing from New York causing the flight to arrive 2 hours behind schedule. Now of course I understand that the airline did not intentionally delay the flight however when asked for any assistance on booking a hotel, since I was told my flight was pushed over until the next morning, I was told by a representative both at the airport and on the phone that this was not their problem and just deal with it! Since I booked my trip through Expedia I gave them a call and they helped out with voucher covering a portion of my hotel fee as a courtesy which was very kind. It's not what you say it's how you say it! Never again will I fly American Airlines. "
"   Flew Orlando to Washington, D.C. This my 4th flight in a row with American Airlines where they have moved my seat after booking. I specifically selected either window seats for all my flights. When you are 6ft 3 inches the other seats just don't work. I'm tired of paying for a specific seat and getting bumped to a middle seat every time. I will be sure to share my experiences with everyone I know. Thus based strictly on the customer service of the airline."
"   Flew Philadelphia to Montego Bay, Jamaica. American Airlines deliberately delayed our flight in order to accommodate a connecting flight coming from another state so they only had to provide one trip but thereby inconveniencing all travelers they willing delayed which ruined our first day of our vacation and honeymoon. The airline was not forthright about its decision and we were given two different reasons which both proved to be untrue. I attempted to contact AA directly and was basically told in several email responses that we eventually got you there so get over it! I will never fly AA again and warn all who consider using them to do your research and look for better options. Not user friendly at all."
"   Flew Seattle to Austin. I bought this ticket weeks ago and was given seat 21 D. When I arrived to check in the terminal would not accept my ID so I waited in line for special services for 57 minutes once I looked at my watch. Only 3, sometimes 4 staff were around to take care of a long line. When I checked in I found that there was no seat for me. The excuse being that there was a change of equipment. However since there was a 21 D on this plane what difference is that? I was offerred the back row in exchange, no regret, not sorry, so nothing. Then I was told by this astonshing gate man that If I was nice he would not lose interest in helping me. Is this behaviour going to be allowed go forward?"
"   Flew Stockholm to New York City. First leg of the trip was met with a 3 hour delay then for our return flight my one son with special needs was not allowed to check in online, while the rest of my family, consisting of myself and my three other children, were cleared. He was subjected to a ""random"" security check that was stress inducing and confusing for my other children. I will never fly Delta again! This is how they treat families with young children? Never again."
"   Flew Tampa to Raleigh-Durham. Kudos to Delta for going above and beyond. I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option. WiFi was provided though I did not attempt to use it so cannot comment on speed. If Delta continues to provide this level of service I will continue to fly with them.

   Flew Washington to Tampa. American Airlines is the worst airline possible. They are currently 2 hours behind flight time for no apparent reason and are offering no sort of compensation for the delay time. The whole flight has been delayed from 8.20 pm land time to 10.20 pm land time.
"   Flight from Los Angeles delayed. Anticipated agents with a sense of urgency when we got off directing us. Would have been nice if a better job was done getting us off the plane ahead of other passengers. Fortunately, we made the connection. People had moved around. I had someone in my seat. Someone else mentioned others had moved around. Just find a seat. This caused a problem for the one attendant. The male attendant laughed, threw his hands up and commented, 'ain't my problem', and then began to gossip with one of the other flight attendants about the one taking roll call. Please be a team and be professional. Now a maintenance issue. Hope to be on my way soon."
   Flight from New York to Phoenix was more than an hour late due to technical problems and I missed my connecting flight to Ontario. They rebooked me and made me wait for more than 6 hours here in Phoenix. Left to wonder why the airline maintenance in New York didn't recognize the problem ahead of time and why they noticed this just a few minutes before the actual departure when the plane had been parked there for a while. This caused 6 hours of chaos. First and last time with this airline.
   Fly American Airlines from Dallas every week to Chicago and back to Dallas every week and have not or arrived on time. Frequent flyer miles - still can't retrieve them and get the run around all the time. Don't know why anyone would rely on them. I'm canceling my next month of travel! 
"   Fort Lauderdale to New York La Guardia. I am very disappointed with this airline, not only did it delay our flight twice by 2 hours each time, I then got tickets to a more resonably timed flight to a different airport in NYC and as soon as I booked the next flight I got a text saying that one was delayed longer than the previous ones. When calling customer service they were very cold and seemed to just be reading off of a script, rather than listening to my frustration.  So disgusted with the lack of compassion if I wanted generic conversation and answers I would have called a recorded line"
   Fort Lauderdale to Richmond. I'm very disappointed with Delta Air Lines. You should not have to pay extra to bring luggage and to pick a seat on the plane. The lady picking seat assignments was very rude when I was trying to ask questions. Both of my flights were delayed do to Flight attendance not being on time. I will never book with this company again. A 6 hour trip turned into 8. I would have expected better for a company I paid more for.
"   Fort Lauderdale to Washington. The flight was delayed by almost an hour, and once they called us from the terminal they had not even gotten other flight out of the airplane and had us standing in line for 15 minutes. On the plane, they claimed to never have picked up their free snacks from their last stop, so all they have is ones you have to pay for. The wifi was unavailable for our flight. Once we landed (late from our estimated arrival time) we were waiting in line to get to the terminal for about 15 minutes for the so called ""wing men"" or something like that to help get the plane there safely, and now we have been waiting in the plane for apparently a designated person who can operate the ramp so that we can get off this flight from hell. We are currently still waiting. I do not plan on using this airline again."
"   From all the bad reviews I've read here, it seems like AA doesn't really care about it's customers, but I'll write this review anyway. I have just flown from Montreal to Charlotte, and I was mistreated by a flight attendant for no reason. The airplane had already landed and we were waiting our turn to stop at the gate, which was taking a while, I needed to go to the restroom really bad, and since I didn't know how much longer it would take, I decided to get and go. I told the flight attendant in the rear of the airplane that I needed to go really bad, the other flight attendant in the front, who never bothered to ask if I had any health issues that would force me to go even if it wasn't the appropriate time, simply said in the mic for the entire flight to hear, ""we are all going to have to wait here until this person in the restroom returns to his seat."" Is that the best way to handle this?"
"   Ft Lauderdale to Amsterdam via Atlanta. I am a Diamond Medallion, almost 2 million mile flyer. I have flown Delta forever and stand behind the company as (generally) nearly world-class. On this trip I really needed some help, asked for it, and was ignored by Delta. I flew FLL-ATL-AMS, travelling in Delta One and First Class, connecting in AMS to KLM for onward travel. I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem. Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for “meet and assist” help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare – my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off. As a passenger asking for help I hoped they would step up. I am hugely disappointed in their lack of response. Apparently loyalty is one–way only."
"   Glasgow to Providenciales via Miami. The worst Airline we have ever flown. Completely ruined a £19,000 holiday. American Airlines lost our luggage containing baby milk. Long story short baby became ill from having to use different milk. We had to leave Turks and Caicos after 4 days losing 6 days at £1,100 a night. Contacted a woman on American Airlines who changed our flights to go home via New York so the baby could get better and we arrived at Providenciales to find that our flights had been changed to economy from business class and also that we would have to pay baggage fees. Now in New York trying to get home and we are being charged again for flight to Glasgow! I am utterly disgusted with this airline.  Avoid this airline at all costs."
"   Grand Forks to Baltimore Washington via Minneapolis. The flight attendants were good, the luggage handlers were bad. I could see them from my 13A seat. They threw people's into the luggage vehicles with no care. My bag which I bought and used just for that trip now looks like it's 15 years old. Not good for such a massive airline. Feeling disappointed."
"   Greensboro to London via Atlanta. Complaints sent to Delta for reference to anybody misguided enough to think of flying with them. 3 flights on delta in 3 days, each flight significantly delayed, due to incompetence at a level I have never experienced before, including over an hour to load freight that arrived late, and gate staff posting an hour delay resulting in passengers leaving the gate then scrambling to get them back to the gate. Three flights overbooked, incredible. And to add insult to an already desperately bad service the cabin staff closed one of the two business toilets twice, once after service and once just before landing for ""staff use"" and I was told to either wait 5 minutes because staff have priority or join a growing queue of paying passengers. I will attempt to never fly Delta again."
"   Greenville to Las Vegas return via DFW. My biggest complaint is when I was dropped off by a tour company at Las Vegas (after a 14 days trip) for my return trip home 6+ hours before the flight boarded American refused to check my bags. They said their policy was not to accept baggage until four hours before a flight. Effectively I was being asked to sit in the main departure lobby for 3.5 hours to check luggage. This was unacceptable. After I complained to a self-check attendant she finally agreed to issue boarding passes and said we could gate check one piece of luggage each complimentary. I had been unable to check in electronically due to the tour and spotty internet access. We carried four pieces of luggage, one carry-on each and one piece each we intended to check, to Gate D which is a really long hike. We did this and were accommodated but had to sit with the luggage all evening and take it with us when we went to eat. None of this made sense. Why would American risk making a customer angry and forego $50 ($25 each checked bag x 2) in revenue by refusing to check bags on arrival and forcing gate check? We were tired, hungry, facing a red-eye flight and just wanted to be shed of the baggage. Now let's backtrack to our departure from Greenville-Spartanburg. The flight crew did not show up on time. The captain and first flight attendant showed up for the flight at 7:50 for an 8:05 flight. The other attendant/s and co-captain showed up at 8 sharp. Needless to say we left late. Our connection through DFW was not pleasant. When our flight landed we sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes waiting for a gate. We were told we would taxi to three different gates before the plane actually moved to the original one. We barely made our connection with time for a restroom break. When we departed Las Vegas McCarran to return home the rest rooms at Gate D used by American were filthy. A janitorial staff member was present but did not appear to be doing much. Many urinals in the men's room were cordoned off and out of service. The final leg from Charlotte to Greenville-Spartanburg was on a very old CRJ500 that was so old the upholstery on the head rests was peeling off. This was our first experience with American and may be our last."
   Guatemala City to Montreal via Atlanta on 1st February. The first leg we were in first class. The steward who served us from Guatemala City to Atlanta (DL910) was excellent. One could not ask for better service. We would like to pass this on to him and add it to his file. The rest of the flights were okay. 
"   Guayaquil to Miami. Horrible experience, the flight was late and we missed our connection. The crew told me that after our delay we would be on time. The agent at the airport was no help. On top of it our meal at the plane was as cheap as it can get, and it was an international flight. I will never fly American Airlines again. I would give a 0 rating if there was the possibility."
"   Had a very pleasant flight with Delta from Atlanta to Bogotá. Delta uses a narrow-body Boeing 757-200 for this flight, which features the same business class as in domestic flights. It has five rows with 2x2 recliner seats. But for a four-hour flight, this is perfectly sufficient. The service was very good, and the food was tasty. Delta usually has a meat and a vegetarian option on this flight. I had a salad, Ravioli with fresh vegetables and a fruit platter for desert. I could not have asked for more."
"   Had nothing but problems on this trip with Delta Air Lines. Flight from Tucson was cancelled delaying trip for a day. On the way back we had 2 stops. Flight from Portland delayed, no reason given. Flight in Seattle delayed, no reason given, which made us late for final leg of trip out of LA. Although plane to Tucson was still on the ground they would not let us board. The airline provided a hotel room. However, it took over 2 hours to get luggage and to the hotel room despite hotel being less than 2 miles from the airport. Returned the following day to fly to Tucson. Gate agent missing, total chaos, and plane left late.

"
"   Harrisburg to Orlando via Philadelphia. The flight to Philly was delayed twice for maintenance, the second time leading me to miss my connecting flight. It was then rescheduled and we switched planes. As soon as we all finished boarding the new plane, they made us get back off due to another maintenace issue even though they knew there was a problem before we boarded. I missed my new connecting flight! They then had to send us ON A BUS to make our new connecting flights, that had been changed 3 times at that point. The bus took us to the connecting airport (Philly), where we had to go back through TSA all over again and wait for a few hours for my flight to Orlando, which was my final destination. I was on vacation for 3.5 days, meeting my family in Disney, and by the time I got there I missed out on an entire days worth of activities/reservations. What a waste of money spent on booking this trip! Not to mention it was a waste of one of my very few vacation days that I was lucky to even get approved through work. I was originally to arrive in Orlando before noon, but I ended up getting there that night. This is not the first issue I've had with American Airlines at the Harrisburg airport. I can't even properly do all areas of this review because I wasn't even on a plane for my one ""flight"", I was on a bus! The only positive experience was the fact that the ticketing counter service was decent and worked hard to accommodate our travel needs. Do not recommend flying with them if you're on a timeline!"
"   Hayden to Washington Reagan via Minneapolis. I paid full price for a ticket, and was held back until only one seat on the plane was left. Passengers paying with points and even stand-by passengers were allowed to board before me. When I asked why I was being singled out, the gate staff mumbled something about not understanding the ""algorithms"" the airline uses and walked back to her post. Once I was given a boarding pass, I asked the ground crew if it was still OK to bring my carry-on with me, and they said ""yes."" When I finally boarded, however, the attendant said there was no overhead room left for my carry-on and that I needed to walk back to the gate and check it. I've never been treated so badly by an airline, for no apparent reason. Their policy seems to be to overbook and let the passengers and gate-keepers sort it out. They want to guarantee a full plane at a few passengers' expense. The passenger doesn't come first for this airline, only their profits. I will never fly this airline again."
"   Honolulu to Dallas Ft Worth. I have only positive comments. My rear facing window lie flat seat offered comfort and privacy. The food and drink offered (dinner and continental breakfast) were quite good. The entertainment available was good and varied. The most pleasant surprise was a pleasant, helpful and efficient cabin crew. Hopefully this airline is headed back towards former glory."
"   Honolulu to Los Angeles. Was notified my plane was delayed this afternoon. When I asked why I was told ""I don't know"" by both customer service on the phone and customer service at the airport. How can an Airline not know why their planes are delayed. No apologies or anything. My 8 hour trip became 12 hours by the time its all said and done. I'm 6'4"" tall and theres no leg room unless I pay $50.00 for First class so no sleeping foe me. I woke up early and planned my day around original flights. I now will be up over 24 hours because they can't get it right. No compensation either. "
"   Honolulu to Singapore via Narita. Two wonderful flights proving American carriers can give equal or better service if they choose. Lounges, seats, staff, entertainment were all as close to perfect as it gets. Crews were different but very friendly and efficient on both legs. Bravo to Delta for picking up their game. They have won my loyalty."
"   Houston to Albuquerque via Dallas. The airline of excuses and terrible customer service. I said never again the last time I flew American, and I confirmed why today. Rude service, constant delays and lame excuses to explain those delays. I will try to avoid this company as much as I can and fly Southwest instead."
"   Houston to Durango via Dallas Ft Worth. Got delayed with ground crew in Houston today which was not too bad. The pilot tried to make up some time for us, but 5 of us got to our connection gate with plane still there and staff would not let us on. Again not so bad there is a flight leaving at 6 - oh no, now delayed until 9:30 departure and on it's 4th gate change. It's official once again - could have driven in less time. I need a new day."
"   Houston to Miami. After purchasing my ticket I was notified I would have to pay an additional 25 dollar fee to check my bag at the gate. I was fine with This until I was notified it would be 50 dollars instead of 25. After asking why this was the case the attendant rudely stated it's an additional 25 dollars at the gate and I should have paid when I checked in. I told her I checked in online and would happily have paid before going through security if i knew. She rolled her eyes and stated do you want to get on your flight or not. I pulled up the email where it stated you will pay an additional 25 dollars at the gate if you have to check a bag. She stated exactly, 25 dollars additional at the gate and I should have known I check my bag at the counter before security. I paid the 50 and will never fly American again. They are extremely rude and have zero empathy. When buying the ticket it should clearly state it will be 50 dollars to check at the gate and 25 at the counter. I feel like I've been robbed."
"   Houston to Portland via Philadelphia. Rudest customer service representatives, gate attendees and stewardesses I have ever encountered and not just in this trip. Free internet never seems to work. Dealing with a kiosk and rude desk clerks first thing in the morning doesn’t help either."
"   I am currently in Day 4 of a 13 day trip to Ukraine. My bags were checked on Sunday in PHL to JFK then to AMS (KLM) and to KBP (KLM - Ukraine International Airlines) but have still not appeared in Ukraine. I am getting no reasonable assistance from Delta Air Lines to assist me in locating my bags and making sure they get to me in Ukraine. The level 1 and 2 agents in Customer Service and baggage are refusing to own this situation, and pretty much just reading back to me what is on the Delta website. I am now resorting to Social media so hopefully someone outside of the @Delta customer service organization sees this and will reach out to me to assist. I am so dissapointed with the customer experience on this issue. I am a loyal Platinum member who takes brand loyalty very seriously and do not expect to be left high and dry this way."
"   I am extremely disappointed with the service I received at American Airlines I travel quite a lot with American Airlines accruing miles through their AAdvantage program. For the first time I decided to finally use my miles towards a car rental. I went ahead and applied 28,800 miles for a 6 day rental in Mallorca (paid in full). When I came to pick up the car at the PMI airport, the teller did not recognize the voucher and prompted me to provide my credit card. At first I thought it was only for incidentals but at the end of my trip, they charged my card in full ($274). I only realized this after I arrived back home. I contacted American Airlines and informed them of the issue. They acknowledged that Avis (the rental car company) made a mistake and that they would facilitate a refund of my miles. After a few days passing, I did not hear back from American Airlines nor did I see the miles credit back on my AAdvantage account. I followed-up with American Airlines. A representative responded to my inquiry and informed me that there is nothing they can do. I repeatedly inquired to escalate this issue to the supervisor. He claimed he was a supervisor and said there was nothing they can do. In short, I spent 28,800 and $274 for a mini-car for 6 days. Is this fair? I think not. American Airlines failed me and I don't plan to use their airline ever again."
"   I am very disappointed. My flight was delayed due to non weather related issues from Houston to Charlotte (layover) to the extent there flight was cancelled. So I would be stuck in Charlotte. I had to rent a car and drive to Augustaand then drive back to Charlotte to fly home. My flight was again delayed and I had to stay the night (again non weather related). I finally arrive in Houston Monday morning and low and behold my luggage is delayed on another flight! So I'm late for work, I'm out hundreds of dollars, I do not have my luggage and I am beyond upset! I call and they issue a refund of $96.72. What the heck did that cover! Every time I fly American there are issues. Save yourself time and money and fly with anyone else! Also I paid for the wifi service during the flight and I should have known - it didn't work either. The onboard staff was rude and hasty. They cared more about advertising for their credit card and passing out applications then they did the passengers! I might as well have thrown money out of the window! Even a 1 star rating is too much."
"   I booked a flight from Houston to Toronto with a layover in Chicago. My flight from Chicago to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3 p.m. We were supposed to start boarding at 2:30 p.m. My flight into Chicago landed at 2:10 p.m. after which I ran to get to my gate. I arrived there at 2:25 p.m. and waited for them to start boarding. At around 2:35 p.m. the agent at the counter said that they were waiting on a crew member to start boarding, that she was flying in to gate L10, and would come right over (we were at gate L8). After about 10-15 minutes we got another update that the crew member had landed and was on her way over. At around 3:10 p.m. we started boarding and was on the plane waiting to leave by 3:30 p.m. The pilot announced that there would be a bit of delay because there was a plane in front of us. So we waited. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the storm that they were trying to avoid had hit Toronto so we couldn't leave. We were going to turn back and deplane, that the delay would be about 4 hours. Then when we deplaned, they cancelled the flight. I called the rebooking number to book another flight and they put me on the 11:52 a.m. flight the next morning. Tried to get a hotel voucher and the agent says to me that in the system, the reason for the booking was as a result of weather, so no vouchers were being offered. I countered that had we not waited on that crew member and left at 3 p.m. as originally scheduled, we would've missed the storm. He said that in the system it says weather and there's nothing he could do."
"   I bought the ticket at 7.45pm for a 8.55 pm flight directly at the airport to fly from New York JFK to Boston. The agent did not mentioned any late departure and a couple of minutes later I saw that the incoming flight from Boston was late, however, it was not until 30 mins later that they announced that the outgoing flight was late. It seems like they were retaining from announcing that the flight was late in order to maximize sales. I have flown American Airlines a couple of times recently and the company is as bad as other American airline companies. They all try to over utilize their planes in order to maximize their profits but the customer experience is becoming so terrible!"
"   I flew from Baltimore to Atlanta on July 1st, and I had a connecting Delta flight to Amsterdam. I arrive in Atlanta at 1730 hours and was expected to go from Terminal A to Terminal F in 15 minutes which is impossible. Now it gets worse, no one in the Atlanta Customer service could help me they said pick up the courtesy phone and try to get another flight. The lady on the phone says they can not get me out of Atlanta until July 5th. I stayed on the phone for over an hour while she tries to find me a earlier flight. I said you are going to put me in a hotel for 2 days with no food. All I hear is I am sorry. She found a flight on July 3rd at 10:30pm. Then, they had to make another connection from Amsterdam to Kiev Ukraine final destination. I arrived at 0030 July 4th. I had a lot of family wondering where I was. They waited 12 hours for me.  Maybe combining Air France, KLM and Delta is too much for 1 airline to handle. I was very disappointed with Delta."
"   I flew this morning from Charlottesville, VA to Boston, MA with a layover in New York at La Guardia. The flight from Charlottesville was delayed by 30 minutes, making me very afraid that I would miss my connecting flight in NY as the turnaround was very quick. Made it to La Guardia and ran to the Gate listed on my boarding pass, only to learn that the Gate had been switched. I was never notified and there was no announcement made. The flight from La Guardia left 35 minutes late. Onboard that flight, I was seated in the one row on the entire plane that was skipped for snacks/drinks. No apologies were made, and no one even acknowledged us at all. It felt as though we were intentionally being ignored. All in all, I feel quite disrespected and don't intend to fly with Delta again. There was one flight attendant on the flight out of Charlottesville who stood out for her excellent customer service and great attitude. "
"   I flew with my family from Dallas Fort Worth to Los Angeles with no problems. We check in at the personal check in because we are flying as a family and I have car seats. They took care of us exceptionally well as I asked them to change/arrange seats so my wife could sit with one kid and I could sit with another kid, no problem then we went through security. However on the way back I was directed to the kiosk checking only and I got annoyed because I wanted to check in with a person so we could change our seats. They refused and said I had to use the kiosk no exceptions. They said I had to go upstairs after security at the actual gate. So I went up there and asked them to arrange the seats so each parent could sit with a kid but they said the flight was full and they could not change seats. I told them my departure flight was the same way and they were able to change my seats but the person refused to do so. So I got mad and just left and let it be. I am writing to complain about American Airlines staff at LAX airport and their very unreasonable accommodation for family and kids traveling abroad. DFW seems to accommodate just fine but LAX is not so accommodating. This is just my experience and not representing all passengers. Hopefully they will read this and change their policies."
"   I fly AA moderately regularly between Philadelphia and San Diego. I often travel with surfboards and pay the $150 each way for this service ($200 internationally). However, AA takes no responsibility for damage to the surfboard even though I am effectively paying for an additional ticket to travel. I think this is completely messed up. This past trip I took a board out to my daughter that she built this past summer. It was packed exceptionally well. Wrapped in bubble wrap, covered in cardboard on all surfaces and more bubble wrap on the rails of the board and the whole thing put into a padded surfboard travel bag. Got it to San Diego and the rails were crushed in two places and there was a big heel dent in the bottom on the board. It was like the baggage handlers went out of their way to destroy the surfboard. OK, AA will pay the damages. Nope, the fine print says they are not responsible and they turn their backs. That's it. Game over. I hate AA big time. But there is no other choice. Good luck."
"   I fly quite a bit so I think I have a balanced view of what a fair service is. The return ticket business class Amsterdam to Portland was about 4500 euros, which is a lot of cash. For this amount you expect a good service, tasty food, friendly staff and up to standard infotainment and comfy seats. You might feel this coming but unfortunately its none of the above. The service is the part which is most disappointing: its unfriendly, after dinner they disappear and its really up to you to get any drink or food or about 3-4 hour when they appear again to get ready for landing. There is very limited choice of movies, seats are small and don't really flat-out. This whole package might have been good value in 1980 but its really outdated. Would definitely not recommend Delta Air Lines.
"
"   I had a connecting flight from Miami to London. The boarding had started early and it was underway when I got to the gate. The cabin crew were greeting passengers during boarding. It seemed that the crew were happy to be there and were chatty. flight left the gate 10 minutes early so arrived into London 30 minutes early. The dinner service was quite quick. I had to decline the dessert as I was full from the main course. The breakfast was ok as I had a fruit bowl.
"
"   I had a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta and connecting flight from Atlanta to Virginia. ""Due to weather"" we were in the air for an hour on which I got left behind from my connecting flight. I got to the gate at 10.30 and the flight was departing at 10.40 and the plane left early. I was left behind in an airport and city I don't know. I proceeded to the gate where Delta employees were ""helping"" customers, but in reality they weren't. One employee started yelling at a customer for not standing in a single file line. After waiting for almost an hour to see if I could catch another flight to my final destination, I finally got to the counter and the delta employee was rude, not helpful and wasn't listening to my needs. All he offered was a flight the next day at 12.07 pm and told me if I didn't like it I could get on the phone and find an alternative. So I got on the phone with a Delta representative, explained my situation and she wasn't helpful either. I asked to be put on a flight with the partner airline that was leaving that same night and her response was no. After being on the phone for 45 mins all I got was a flight from atl to Norfolk at 7am. I got to Norfolk at 9.05 so had missed my interview and was also one hour and 30 mins from from my destination. I am not pleased at all with the way Delta managed the situation. On top of all that my connecting flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale got delayed by 2 hours and no information was given on why it was delayed. Needless to say I will not recommend or flight with Delta again!"
"   I had a flight scheduled for Sept 5th 2017 from New York to Pittsburgh with a layover in Boston, to go surprise my mother for her birthday. I booked this flight through Justfly.com in April. My mother passed away in early August a month before her birthday, which was the whole meaning behind me taking the flight to Pittsburgh. I contacted justfly.com and American Airlines informing them of the situation and that I was not going to be making that flight. Not only was it a very long process to even speak to someone about the situation, but that they could not refund the flight and could only give me flight credit if I gave them a copy of my mothers death certificate and proof that she was my mother (I was advised against giving that those are personal documents that would not be asked for prior to booking a flight). I would rather pay double the price with a different airline and website than fly with with American Airlines again. "
"   I had heard terrible press about American Airlines - I am so disappointed to find it's all true. Despite booking 5 months ago, I was put on standby due to overbooking for my flight from Santiago to Dallas then Hong Kong. Passengers from a flight to Miami, cancelled only that day, were given seats ahead of me! After a harrowing 3 hour wait, I was given one of the last seats just as the plane commenced boarding. Check in staff were very very slow. Not sure what the problem was but it took an hour for me to reach the front of a 10 person queue with 3 counters open. Onboard staff were also quite rude - they appear to hate their jobs and certainly the passengers! Abrupt, unresponsive. All very different to the cheerful, brand-proud messages in the recorded safety briefing, about how great AA is! I won't fly with them again. Just not worth the stress of not knowing if you'll actually fly with them, despite a paid booking."
"   I had no choice but to fly American Airlines due to the fact that an organization purchased the ticket for me (otherwise I would have picked any other airline except AA based on prior experiences). Unbelievably rude and dismissive in-flight service: I got up to ask the flight attendant for water in the bathroom/mid-section area. She was bent down and shoveling trays inside a cabinet. There were other passengers standing around her - clearly waiting for her to finish. But not only did she not pay attention to any of us, but when I gently asked if I could just grab the water and pour it myself, she glared and almost shouted at me - ""Can you not see that I'm in the middle of something!"" Then she thrust the bottle into my hands and as I turned away she said, ""Hold up! Where do you think you are going with that bottle of water!"" Another passenger around us took some empty cups and passed to me as we poured each other water and did not want to get in the way of this flight attendant's anger. When it came time for sandwich/food service. This same flight attendant pulled the cart asking people ""sandwich? sandwich?"" When she came to my row (which is not far from the front), I used my most friendly voice to ask her could she tell me what kind of sandwich are were. To my surprise, she gave out a loud and exasperated sigh - turned to ask her colleague about the type of sandwich, turned to me and said, ""it's turkey, turkey!"" Then without asking me whether I wanted it or not - she threw the sandwich down on my tray table. I felt so insulted by this flight attendant. No more American Airlines for me, my family, or friends!"
"   I have been so impressed with Delta on our flight from Rome to Detroit, the inflight staff were awesome. They remembered the drinks we typically order, they actually smiled at us. The food was pretty decent as far as flight meals go. And on our long flights they kept us well hydrated and well fed.  Finally, when we needed to ask questions at the ticket counter, the staff was very kind and helpful. I did not feel like I was putting them out when I had questions. Thanks very much Delta. We will definitely fly with you again!"
"   I have flown with Delta multiple times as well as Southwest. First of all, I can almost assure you 95% of the employees there get paid to not care about their jobs. When I arrived 25 mins before boarding time, I had to get a different flight. Employee neglected to let me know there were standby flights available. When I was leaving Nashville, I was 33 minutes before boarding time and was still considered ""late"", this lady only let me know the standby option. Clearly the employees are clueless about their jobs and have no sympathy whatsoever. I've never sat in such a tiny seat, I felt absolutely trapped and terrible on only an hour and a half plane ride. When I got on standby the guy at the podium let me know I was the second name to be called. After several names being called, I was the last one along with two other men. They made me walk all the way to the airplane door just to let me know they had miscounted the seats and were fine with sending me away. As I waited for the next standby flight, the lady took forever and continued to do other things while I was sitting right in front of her. Then said the next standby was at another gate, to get in line for 10 mins and wait for them to announce a gate change. I went to the different gate that they announced just for the employees to look at me because they werent ready for that flight yet. The neglect and ignorance of this company is unreal. Not only did I pay $300+ for some stupid flights with layovers just to pay $75 extra because of an undereducated worker. I've never ridden such a terribly serviced plane."
"   I have had the worst experience flying American Airlines. My flight was on 3/10/17 from Madison to Chicago with a connecting flight from Chicago to Dayton. My flight from Madison was at 2.56 pm, then it was delayed to 4.30, then to 6 and to 7 and 7.30. After I arrived to Chicago my flight to Dayton was cancelled due to no crew. The person who helped me with rebooking told me that I have an option to buy another ticket. This made me furious, what should I buy another ticked for a cancelled flight? He rebooked a flight from Chicago to Philadelphia and from Philadelphia to Dayton. He gave me a voucher for food which was not enough and had to pay extra money out of my pocket. The hotel was in Schaumburg and had to take a taxi back to the airport at 2.30 am as the shuttle did not start until 6 am. It cost me $75 for the taxi. I will never fly with American Airlines. It was a nightmare experience."
"   I just want to make it known for anyone debating airlines that JetBlue and Southwest are far superior arilines. They allow two carry-ons for those who don't want to wait for an added 40 minutes at the carrousel for a small luggage bag. They won't make you check your small bag on a half empty flight like Delta. I've sadly consistently had poor service, lots of attitude, and the rules they have are nonsensical. This will be the fourth time I've flown Delta and it will be the fourth time there's been a problem. Never again. "
"   I planed a trip to Las Vegas and started searching for flights, most important for me was the flight time. It was my first time flying Delta and I and the rest of my family were positively surprised. Beginning from the ground service to the cabin I was impressed, the only thing I could say is that they could do with slightly better seats in economy class. Another thing I would like to point out is the ground service - lost and found items and damaged luggage. Unfortunately it happened to me that we lost important documents and my luggage was damaged. Delta contacted me right after we landed informing us that they found our documents and money. In terms of my damaged luggage, I made a claim, Delta responded in minutes, with a very professional service, returning the whole cost. "
"   I walked into the Alexandria Airport (Louisiana) about 5:45am, I went to the check in desk, the self check in was out of order. No one was at the checkin desk. I stood there waiting to be checked in about 30 minutes. The time for my flight came and went. A few minutes after my flight time a man finally shows up, I tried to check in and he informed me that I missed my flight and if I wanted on the next one I'd have to pay 75 dollars. Negative experience could have been avoided if this man was doing his job! Also had the self check in been working I could have avoided missing my flight. This is my frist time flying American Airlines and I will not fly with them again!"
"   I wanted to take the time to recognize the Delta Staff that helped in making the start of my vacation an absolute dream! As a Stage 4 Breast Cancer patient they literally made the start of 2017, a start I will not forget! On January 2nd my friends and I were set to board a Delta flight from Chicago to Paris where we had a layover before getting to Dublin. I made Delta aware two months prior that I needed an accommodation made to have a seat in Bulk as I had just finished chemo in September and my oncologist wanted me up moving and stretching throughout the flight. Unfortunately, upon arriving to check in, I noticed that this hadn't been done, but explained my situation to them and they kindly placed me in an appropriate seat.  Prior to boarding my name was called and they had decided to move me into business class. In addition when they found out I was flying with friends they moved their seats up to premium economy, so that I would be able to easily be able to walk up and down the aisles and talk with them. Throughout the flight the staff checked on me and my friends as well. Delta Airlines has a Breast Cancer Research Foundation and  this is the first time that I've actually seen a company represent the Pink Ribbon so well! The staff didn't have to care about my situation or consider my friends in the mix, but they did and the fact that they made this flight what it was to me, means absolutely everything! "
"   I was appalled by the last of service and poor treatment given to me by American Airlines today. I have an extra three hours to wait at the airport and write this review because I was bumped from my connecting flight without any notice or compensation. The first flight was delayed an hour and fifteen minutes due to mechanical issues. Apparaty a bird had crashed into the plane the night before. So rather than have the issue fixed before takeoff, they make an entire plane full of passengers wait on a hot, sticky plane for an hour. Because the plane departed late American Airlines rebooked all passengers with connecting flights. I was one of them, the problem is that my connecting flight was delayed so I made the flight with time to spare. The aircraft didn't even change, the same plane I took on the first flight was also the same plane I would have taken for the second flight. But did American Airlines care? No! They bumped me from the flight I was supposed to be on and gave my seat away. The flight was of course overbooked - as per usual for American Airlines. After being treated rudely by the gate manager I went to customer service to ask for a refund (I knew I wouldn't get it but hey, never hurts to ask) and was told the best he could offer was a $12 meal voucher. Wow. To contest this further I have to send them an email but I am sure I will never be compensated or given an apology. Badly done American, Badly done."
"   I was at the gate for my flight from Atlanta but the sign showed a different flight number and there were a lot of people standing around waiting to board. I went to the counter and asked if I was at the right gate, and they said yes, but they couldn't change the sign because the plane that was at that gate wasn't able to pull out. They didn't give much of an explanation, but our aircraft was there, but wasn't able to get to the gate. At no point did they give an announcement to inform the customers. Eventually they re-routed the flight to the next gate and everyone deplaned. I knew I would miss my next flight, so I was able to get a new ticket from another counter prior to departing. When I got to Dallas I went to the customer service counter and despite a line that extended down the airport corridor, there were only 2 attendants present. Surprised me since they knew how many people missed flights with the three aircraft that were late arrivals. Eventually they did get other attendants, but it took 1.5 hours to get to the counter. When I inquired about lodging she informed me that it was due to weather! I couldn't believe it."
   I was headed from Chicago to Dallas Fort Worth with an 80 year old friend to attend her grandson's wedding. Upon arrival I dropped my friend off at the curb of the airport while I parked my vehicle. An American Airline employee saw me and immediately assisted me. Even though he was not yet on duty he still jumped in and helped me from start to finish. The flight was smooth and I cannot thank George and American Airlines enough for their wonder service!
"   I was in transit in Minneapolis from Tokyo, in order to go back home in Monreal, on August 5th. My flight has been delayed until August 6th 12h00 pm. The aircraft had a mechanical problem which would be supposed to be fix up during the night. Because I was in transit, I didn't havethe right to go out of the airport to the hotel that was offered by the airline. I was the only customer in this situation, so they managed my problem by giving me a mattress, a pillow and a blanket, and told me to sleep in the airport. I asked if it would be possible to open one of the Delta Lounge for the night, but I was told that it was not possible. I waited 1 hour and a half for the pillow and the blanket. One of the passenger told me that that it was the second cancellation in 2 days for this flight going to Montreal. "
"   I was on a Delta flight from Chicago to Los Angeles with a connection at Minneapolis. I had a horrible experience. The layover time was 30 mins, which I knew to be risky because it includes the time it takes to deboard a plane. We landed on time (1 minute early) and the race began. A Delta employee gives me the gate number but doesn't tell me that the connecting gate was at the other end of the terminal and would take a 10 minute walk! Regardless, I arrive at the gate before 30 mins (it took me maybe 28 minutes) but I was told I couldn't board because the airplane door was closed. I was not offered an apology. To make things worse, I had talked to a Delta employee on my way to the gate and asked them to call the delta employees at the connecting gate and let them know that I am on my way.  That was the last flight to LA of the day, and I had to sleep on the ground because I wasn't offered a hotel. I took another flight the next day, which fortunately was half empty. Other than the terrible customer service, the plane was clean. However, the wifi wasn't working. We got the standard minimal beverages and some peanuts."
"   I was on flight to Charlotte from Munich via London. My plane from Munich was already delayed due to weather, so my 1.5hr layover in London for a USA flight was cut down to 40 minutes (in which I needed to change Terminals, go thru security and get to the other side of the airport). My American Airlines flight which left on February 22 at 1:30 pm was already closing, so I had started to run. I finally arrived, out of breath and about to collapse. The gate lady let me quickly run across the hall to purchase a bottle of water before I dehydrate. Finally on the plane. I sat a good 10 minutes in stillness, trying to catch my breath. I wanted to get comfortable and ""set up"" for a transatlantic flight when I noticed that I had lost my cellphone! I ran up to the stewardess and explained my situation. She calmed me well, but explained that I couldnt leave the plane. Another staff came up and inquired what was wrong. I told them I needed to leave and get my phone, thinking I hopefully left it by the gate or the small store across the hall. He walked out and some minutes later returned with my phone. My vacation was saved and I couldn't thank him enough. Both of those flight attendants had done such an awesome job at calming and fixing the whole ordeal. I flew again with AA on my return trip on March 6th to London and they were my attendants again! It was wonderdul to see them again. I will always recommend American Airlines. "
"   I was scheduled on an American Airlines flight last night from Phoenix to Omaha. We boarded the flight and then was told there was a mechanical. Not a problem. I’m a million miler and understand. As soon as the problem was fixed the pilots timed out. Once again I totally understand. I don’t want a fatigued pilot flying the plane and it is an FAA rule that the airline can’t ignore. The problems started after all this. They said they were getting new pilots and it could take a couple of hours so they wanted everyone to deplane. At this point I’m not thrilled but at least we are going to make it to Omaha and I should be able to at least get in a half a day’s work the next day. We wait for two hours and still no pilots. They make an announcement that the pilots are coming in on a flight in 15 minutes and will be at the gate directly across from us. That was great news but a total lie. A few minutes later I hear someone on a radio say the pilots had never acknowledged the tag. My understanding is pilots never respond to these requests so I’m not sure why they even try or get the passengers hopes up. So the plane lands and deplanes I see the pilots get off and walk away. The gate has still not told anyone. About a half hour later the gate agent announces the flight is officially cancelled. The airline knew there was a shortage of pilots and no one ever accepts a tag so why did they hold us all captive for four hours after they knew the flight would cancel anyway. I would have been fine if as soon as the pilots timed out they cancelled the flight knowing they didn’t have any pilots to cover it. Things like this are why people hate airlines. Not only did they make me miss a whole day of work, they wasted four hours of my day for no reason."
"   I was supposed to fly Fresno-Dallas-Chicago-Toledo. First flight was delayed almost an hour. Get to Dallas and my flight got delayed until 7am, and then 6am and then 12am and then back to 7am. My connecting flight was at 8am in Chicago meaning I was going to miss it, however I was put on the earliest flight to Chicago that would get me to my connecting flight barely. Then come to find out your system gave away my ticket to Toledo. I complained and was told that yes it was a mistake and that the flight was full. I had a ticket with a seat but because of AA system I lost it? I called and complained to try and get some compensation but was told off by the supervisor because even though it was a mistake by AA all he could do was apologize. He and I went back and forth until he finally hung up on me. I feel very disrespected as a customer.  I am astounded at how I was treated. "
"   I was taking what was to be a simple flight from Phildelphia to Chicago with a quick stopover in Detroit. When I landed in Detroit (before 8am), I saw that the flight had been delayed by an hour. This was not a bad thing, given that my original flight would have been boarding by the time I landed and I needed to get from an A gate to a B gate. That flight landed, deplaned, some crew arrived and got on board, and we are waiting, and waiting. They told us we were waiting for a First Officer, they had no idea where he was but hadn't shown up. So while we waited, the crew for our flight timed out. So, they send us a few gates down, where we waited for a flight that was coming in from Minneapolis. This was delayed, then delayed some more, then mechanical issues, then for two hours they told us the plane had pulled away from the gate, but hadn't taken off yet. From what I can tell, the plane never did, and I am not convinced there even was a plane coming. So, at around 3 something, they move us yet again from a B gate, back over to an A gate. Here, the gate agent told me there was a 5:40 flight, but that this flight was scheduled to take off at 5:25, so I should stick with that. All things were looking good (9 hours later) to get this 5:25 flight out. Plane lands on time, plane deboards, some crew get on board, and we are all eagerly anticipating geting on and getting home. Then they start delaying us in 10 minute incriments. Now, while it seemed like some sort of sick joke, the announcement comes across that once again they cannot find a pilot or the first officer. So we waited, and waited, and waited. The horrible realization was creeping up that time was of the essence and I likely was not going to get home that day for no good reason. There was one final flight out that night at 8:30. I went to customer service, where she was anything of customer friendly, but I finally got one of the last two seats available on that flight. She told me I had been switched to the 5:40 flight and missed it, which I had never been told happened and had been given a boarding pass and seat assignment for the flight I was standing waiting on. She accusingly said, ""Well here you go Stephanie, if that's even your name"" as she handed me my boarding pass for the 8:30 flight. Not the slightest bit of an apology as I had been stuck there at this point for 11 hours at nobodys fault but Delta. My time is more valuable then a box of snacks and sack of food from Wendys that were tried to buy me off or passify me. I eat organic, gluten free foods, so that wasn't helping my missed work or hunger. Of course no vouchers were offered, as Delta doesn't offer that, nor was any comfort provided in the Sky Club as I was told that was a different branch. All in all we took off a bit after 9pm after being stuck in Detroit for 13 hours. Some may try to say this was a case of winter weather. That is a lie. This was poor planning, negligence, poor service, and a cheap airline that has no consideration for it's customers well being. I travel 60% of the time for work and for the most part am the decision maker on my travel. For the last year and a half I have purposely stopped flying Delta because of too many flight delays, cancellations, and the worst customer service."
"   I will never fly with American Airlines again. I just got back from my annual vacation (Roanoke to Portland) to visit family on the west coast. I have used American Airlines twice now to take this trip, and they completely ruined my vacation both times. Last year, my flight was delayed twice leaving my first airport. This caused me to miss my connecting flight. Then they re-routed me, which added an additional stop, after hours of dealing with rescheduling flights, I got on my flight from Dallas to Portland. Sat on the tarmac for 3 hours then that flight was cancelled. Then I had to wait in line for hours to reschedule yet again. I lost a day and a half of my vacation because of the delays. This year (last week) I was scheduled to fly out at 5:50pm. got to the airport to check in, and my flight had been canceled due to the AC on the plane being broken - they couldn't schedule me for another flight out until the next morning. Also, rescheduling resulted in adding an additional stop to my trip. I missed an entire day of this vacation, and had to cancel reservations as a result. They gave me a $200 voucher. Seriously? I don't even want to fly with them again. what good is a voucher going to do? Disgusting!
"
"   I would not recommend American Airlines to anyone. They had me stranded in Charlotte after lying to customers for hours about our delayed flight from Las Vegas to Charlotte. First it was weather related then an airline steward was ""missing"" but on her way which was the reason given for the prolonged delay, at that point it had been already 2+hrs. We finally boarded at 1am, sat there only for them to say the flight was now canceled with no valid reason. The Customer service agents were absolutely awful. Best part of this all is they tell us there are no flights to Charlotte until 10.45pm the following day which was also a lie, they would not offer hotel comp stating that it was weather related delay and they were not responsible for it. So we board a flight to NY, then to Boston get here only to be told that my luggage is in Charlotte and it arrived at 7am, somehow my luggage got here before I did. American Airlines should be ashamed of themselves."
"   I would not recommend to my worst enemy. We booked return flights for a family of 6 from Leeds Bradford to Orlando, flying Delta from Atlanta to Orlando, Orlando to Boston and onward to Amsterdam in November 2015 on a single booking reference and e-ticket, and later booked actual seats. We were split up, some put on standby and some not even on the system despite checking the bookings before starting to travel. At Boston the seats we originally booked could not be given to us as they were ""blocked"" for families. what are 2 grandparents, mother, father and seven year old twins? The seats allocated to us were 2 of the original at the side of the plane, 2 in the row behind the original, the mother moved to economy after being on standby and a seven year old girl to travel by herself. At Amsterdam 4 were on the plane seated in different seats, one was on standby despite the plane being overbooked and one not even on the system"
"   In terms of pricing, American Airlines was very good compared to their competitors. The business class and first class connection between Dallas Fort Worth and Orlando then Orlando to Los Angeles on the return was comfortable. All flights and connections were on time. In fact one departed early to avoid a storm in LAX. The long haul transpacific flight offered a lie flat bed but that had a hump just at the small of your back. If you angle it 170, it disappears. Managed quite a number of hours of sleep. Food service and choice was more than adequate and of course the highlight was the sundae for dessert. However for breakfast they ran out of the egg option and had to settle for fruit and granola on both routes. Service was friendly and efficient. Late night snacks are available on demand and was good. The Bose noise reduction earphones were really effective, but the disposable ear-pieces on the short haul flights were not worth using. I have already booked another flight with AA in April from JFK to Lima Peru. Lets hope they keep it up.

"
"   Indianapolis to Phoenix. Service was fine, the pilot made the softest landing in all my years of flying. The trip to the gate, even though direct, was easy. I was expecting this horrible experience, like I get with United, but it wasn't. It was a normal typical flight. For me that's all I can ask for. There was a delay but they are working all days of the year to get me where I want to go. So this was awesome, thank you for getting me here safely, I look forward to my trip back."
"   It gets a 1 because zero wasn't an option. Our flight originated in Rapid City, SD connecting through Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX and then on to Newark, NJ. We checked four bags/items ($75 b/c the stroller was free) at the urging of the gate attendant at check-in because they advised the flight would be full and there would be little room in the overhead compartments. Upon arriving in Newark, we picked up two bags and the stroller but the other piece of luggage was nowhere to be found. The surly woman in the baggage claim area of American Airlines (AA) said that the bag was put on the wrong flight but that it would arrive later in the evening and be delivered within 24 hours. I then took the day off work ... but the bag never arrived. Several phone calls later, what we know is that they can't find our bag and that they really aren't particularly concerned about it. Almost every representative that we've spoken with in the baggage handling customer service department has been less helpful than the one before. They cannot locate the bag and they're ""not sure what else to tell us at this point"" (that's a quote). Meanwhile, I'm out an expensive Rimowa bag and several thousand dollars in clothing and other items. Some of them with sentimental value and which can never be replaced. Any effort at replacing our items will be a tedious and time consuming process and I'm sure will be laden with red tape and bureaucratic obstacles. And they won't even begin that process for 5 days. Even though they admit that they can't locate the bag and it's coming up on 48 hours here shortly. American Airlines is a joke, they lose your luggage and basically laugh at you when you seek assistance. Two days later and they have no idea where our checked bag is now? This has to be the worst and least helpful customer service. The poorly trained customer service reps at AA are flippant, unhelpful, and totally unsympathetic to one's plight. The fact that this airline carries the name ""American"" in the company's moniker is a disgrace. If you value your personal belongings and don't appreciate being treated like yesterday's used up garbage, do yourself a favor and either find another airline to fly or just stay home."
   It has been 15 years since I have flown American Airlines due to every flight being delayed. Today is no different! Flew from Washington Reagan to Detroit. It is great to have choices because I will never fly American again and will encourage others not to. Looking at the display right now and four flights are delayed - ridiculous!
"   It was a morning flight from Buenos Aires to Miami. There was only one check-in desk for business and first class but it wasn't marked on the screens at all. The staff were nice. The boarding started only 20 min before departure but the passenges were stuck in the jetway for 10 min before getting aboard. Boarding was more or less chaos. Only one of the cabin crew were greeting passenges and the rest of them were just talking to each others. The breakfast was served after take-off and it was quite small for a business class meal. The second meal was a pizza. Ice cream or cake were served between main courses. The seat was good as it's new generation seat for American Airlines business class on B777-300. Not a bad flight but most of the cabin crew just did the minimum. They kept the safety belt signs on for the last 6 hrs with only a few occasions of turbulence.
"
"   It was a terrible experience flying from San Francisco to Dallas Fort Worth with American Airlines. Flight delayed for 2 hours and service was horrible. After landing in DFW, we had to wait an hour for baggage. No one explained why we had to wait! I missed my hotel shuttle because I waited for baggage until 1.30 am. I had to pay for a taxi to get me to the hotel. Do not fly with American Airlines, if your time valuable"
"   I've always been big on traveling but since mid 2013 I have been taking around 8-20 flights a year, domestic and international, mostly for business purposes. Out of all the airlines I have taken (and I fly to some remote places in the world) American Airlines have managed to be the most consistent with their lack of customer care and disorganization and just a huge shame to what you would expect of one of the biggest airlines coming out of the US. Canceling and delaying is something that happens so often that I have become shocked when their flights go as planned, they offer no compensation of course for those delays and time and energy consuming horrible experiences that everyone hates. American Airlines offer no canceling/bumping a flight like 90% of the time, just zero effort to even try and show just a little bit of courtesy toward the customer in general. "
"   Jackson Hole to Reno via Salt Lake City. Weather mishap, compounded by lack of sympathy and poor customer service. Initial flight delayed 2 hours. Missed connection by 10 minutes. No attempt to get me off the plane (or the other 10 people on that connection) quicker was made. We possibly could have made that flight if we were allowed to exit first. Second, calling help line I asked when the next flight out was, she said ""tomorrow"" and laughed. They offer no protection for weather delays, I was given a toothbrush kit with bathroom essentials after lying on the terminal carpet for nine hours. I purchased a bottle of whiskey and put it in my carry-on in Jackson after checking with airline security that this was allowed. The next day, they actually tried to charge me to check my carry-on or dump the bottle out. Since I bought my own hotel room and left the terminal, this bottle was no longer considered safe. When I asked them to comp it as an ""I'm sorry how poor your flight was"" the check in lady said, ""it not like it's our fault you bought whiskey"" - after asking her supervisor, they comped the whiskey. Poor attitude all around. Never fly again if I can avoid it."
"   Jamaica to Indianapolis via Charlotte. Extremely poor customer service. We had a 5 hour layover in Charlotte on our way to Indianapolis and there were earlier flights available, but they refused to switch our flight. There was availability on a flight that was 4 hours earlier, but they said since we had paid a lower fare they would not switch us, even after we tried to pay the difference. They gained nothing by making us wait for no reason and lost a customer."
"   January 2017, Las Vegas to Corpus Christi via Dallas Ft Worth, to Dallas in economy (main cabin extra) on A321 and from Dallas in first (upgrade) on an MD80. Used check in kiosk in LAS; everything is self-service, except weighing the luggage. No lines and fast. In difference to my previous flight with UA a manned premium check in counter was offered as well. TSA in LAS relaxed and fast with basically no lines. LAS seems to be a well run and modern airport. Boarding as indicated and efficient. First segment to DFW was on a modern A321 with back seat screens and headphones for sale (5 USD). As usual for domestic flights in the U.S. drink service only, and some basic food choices plus alcoholic drinks for sale (overpriced and no cash accepted, so irrelevant). Flight packed, seats comfortable for Y and leg room good for Y due to main cabin extra. FA’s were professional, but nothing more. Departure almost on time and early arrival into DFW. All good for a domestic flight; a decent experience. DFW is an efficient airport to transit through and I incurred no problems. DFW-CRP on an old MD80; probably the very last time on this type of plane, as there are not many more in service. Kind of a nostalgic experience, as the DC9 was the first plane i was on as a child. Thanks to an upgrade in F a comfortable flight; old style recliner seats, which I find more comfortable than the newer models. The purser on this flight was exceptionally friendly, attentive and chatty. Drink service only, which is ok for a late evening one hour flight. This flight showed that AA can be a good experience, especially if you get one of the original AA crews. Luggage took longer than expected and my priority luggage came out almost last. So much better than my flight with UA."
"   Just a quick review, since I think so many people only ""review"" when they've had a bad experience. I flew Portland OR - Boston RT and had a terrific experience. Nothing remarkable but online ticketing and check-in was easy, everyone was friendly, got the seats I wanted, no hitches, delays etc. Great experience overall from American Airlines."
"   Kansas City to La Guardia. Horrible experience. Delta should definitely invest more of their budget fixing their airplanes. Sunday I traveled with them out of LGA and because of technical issues flight was delayed 3 hours, then the excuse was that the flight was overbooked and eight people had to leave the plane. Finally today after hours of delay because of technical issues, the flight was cancelled with no more flights available until tomorrow."
"   Kona to Los Angeles. Awful boarding process. The speaker called disabled passengers and military personnel. After they called group 1 (my group) myself and my family preceded to the gate scanned in and started to board the plane. A worker asked what seats we were in before we got to the plane and we told them 4. She allowed us to go. Once we got to the plane a worker asked the people in front of us their seats and let them on. Once we approached she never asked us our seats And very nasty told us ""y'all can't board you have to wait"". I said to her the other worker said we could we're seated in row 4. Her face turned red and she said ""oh ok come on board"" the reason for the hold up was because they were boarding a disabled passenger in the main cabin not first class. I was so mad because she didn't treat the people in front of us like that. After we were seated the rest of the ride went smooth."
"   La Guardia to Cincinnati. I paid a little extra to go with Delta over typical budget airlines, what a mistake! I flown with a dozen or so airlines over the years, and never have I encountered the level of a incompetence and indifference than from the staff of Delta. Not only did the plane arrive 30 minutes late but the stewardesses for the flight arrived an hour past when the flight was scheduled because they were both on separate flights that were also late somehow. Why would you schedule staff to work on one plane when there still in the air working on other plane? This is ridiculous! And this was on a clear summer day, not a winter blizzard. Also, while trying to exchange my tickets weeks in advance because my travel dates changed they resorted to outright extortion. They said they would it cost me $200 per ticket to exchange them for flights that were selling from their own website for $106 each. When I told them that I could just buy new tickets for almost half the price of exchanging them they then told me that they would void my return ticket even though I wasn't trying to chang the return trip. Delta's service is far worse that even the cheapest of the budget airlines. I will never fly with Delta again."
"   La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. American Airlines is definately the worst for being on time. I flew on Tuesday July 18, 2017 from LGA, 3 hours late at 9 am in the am. Then we boarded, then we waited for another half hour, they remembered they needed a pilot - 30 minutes after that, remembered that fuel need to be balanced. Now, 2 days later, 2.5 hours late again. The stewardess just announced after sitting inside the plane for the past hour ""there are some funny points to this flight"". How is wasting people's time for the past two days by over six hours funny? Then give you 1 package of cookies."
"   La Guardia to Louisville. To my horror, I realised that my connecting flight was a codeshare with Delta.  The staff were rude, and the poor management strategies were apparent from a quite empty plane that only offered cramped conditions (with no reclining options) to its passengers. To be fair, I was told that it would cost $50 extra to occupy an empty seat with the extra leg room, and chose not to pay the difference for an hour journey. It seems Delta management have missed out on $50, and confirmed their reputation, and earned a worthy review. The flight was delayed, and only about an hour late, so that was better than expected! "
"   Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Worst customer service ever! Plane was delayed 3 hours when we finally got on, only to sit at the gate for another hour with ""maintainance issues"". The crew would not give any information and were extremely rude. When I asked for a blanket for my 8 year daughter (it was 10:30pm) they said no. Sadly enough this is the 2nd time this happened to me on AA. Never again!"
"   Las Vegas to Minneapolis. The people I talked to on the phone had great service. Counter was a different story. My family had a 4 hour layover in Vegas. We asked for boarding pass so we could go out to grab a bite. They guy first said he couldn't until an hour prior to our flight. We had to explain why we needed our pass before he printed our pass. While doing this he made a couple rude statement, ""how many people do you have? Making me work"" are they not here to help? Next time I'll make sure the person is having a good day before asking about my seats. After all said and done everybody is sitting alone. With a group of 14, five are kids. After a second third time talking to him we finally got the kids together. Forget that we checked in early to try to get seats together, forget that we booked together. Next time I'll fly with someone else."
"   Las Vegas to Seattle. Delta has the worst customer experience team. They cancelled my flight and refuse to provide a refund or alternate ticket, instead they are so generous to waive all the fees and only require me to pay the increased fare price. How generous! This is what I got after waiting on hold for hours, having my call dropped twice, and being transferred to the wrong department twice. Clearly these guys just wanted to get rid of me - and they were successful. I will never fly Delta again."
"   Little Rock to Flint. As a mother traveling with a 3 year old and 5 month old, I had a stroller and bags/carry on. The Delta staff was so helpful. Carried my bags to my seat. My connecting flight they moved my seat so I could have more room with the kids. I had flown other airlines recently instead of Delta. But after this experience I will be sticking with Delta from now on."
"   London Heathrow to Detroit. I was apprehensive about travelling by Delta Air Lines but this was the best flight we have been on travelling to USA. Everything was perfect, the crew were friendly, food was delicious and the seating was really comfortable. Beats BA any day. Thank you Delta. "
"   London Heathrow to Los Angeles. After landing at LAX we were bussed (an extra 30 mins delay) to Terminal B. The AA website said T4 but was never updated. At no time did any AA staff update customers of the change. Terminal B involved 2 hours of shuffling with luggage through 3 security barriers. Then we had to find our driver waiting at Terminal 4, another hour of delays plus we had to walk between terminals. What a disgusting lack of service. I will never fly American Airlines again."
"   London Heathrow to New York JFK.  As we had missed our previous flight due to a delay, we had to be rebooked to a flight later that day which worked out fine. Having only frequently flown United to the US before, I was suprised by the friendly flight attendants. Inflight service and the IFE were fine. As the flights were on time. I appreciate that AA has refurbished thier Boeing 777 fleet and I really the ambient lightning and new IFE. However, cramping in another seat in every row (3-4-3 instead of 2-5-2) makes traveling really uncomfortable. As a 187 cm/88kg Person, the extremely narrow seats makes it always impossible to find a comfortable sitting position. Even our British Airways connecting service from HAM to LHR in an A320 had wider seats. Luckily, the flights from London to New York are not too long. I will avoid flying American the 777-fleet in the future which is a pity as I usually really like these aircraft type."
"   London Heathrow to New York JFK. Boarding was OK. Was feeling a little thirsty before take off and asked one of the cabin crew members for water. It was the most unpleasant exchange I have had with an airline staff. The conversation went: Me: excuse me, can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff (male): what's that? He asked the question in a very rude manner and looked visibly annoyed that I was asking him something. I would have expected something along the lines of: ""I'm sorry mam, I did not hear you."" In any case, I repeated my question. Me: Can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff: Well we're about to take off so I can't. I did not catch the rest of his answer because as he started responding he simply turned around and continued talking as if he wasn't talking to me - all this in a very rude and angry tone. I thought to myself I'm only asking for a glass of water and if indeed it is not possible now, the correct and polite answer would have been: ""I'm sorry mam, but unfortunately we are about to take off so it is not possible right now. We'll bring you a glass after take off."" For someone who travels quite a lot with major airlines and have platinum level with some airline mileage programmes, I was quite shocked because this is really the lowest in terms of the quality of in-flight personnel. I fly American Airlines  rarely but think I will just cross it off my list of respectable airlines. Would absolutely not recommend it. "
"   London Heathrow to Portland. I had the pleasure of travelling to and from Portland with the same cabin crew. They were really efficient, friendly, helpful and informative, not only in terms of in flight support but also useful data and advice re our time in Oregon. Further, despite being very approachable they maintained a highly professional approach. In respect of the food, there was a good range on the menu and the ""hot food"" was actually hot. The only small downside re refreshments was that we were not provided with the usual pre-flight drink on our way back from Portland. Seating and in flight entertainment were fine though I did not find the flatbed particularly comfortable. My thanks to all the great cabin staff( and of course the pilots), for facilitating two enjoyable flights."
"   London Heathrow to Salt Lake City. A very good flight with the attendants being very attentive. Food was as per airline food. Seats were a bit tired but for economy, but reasonable room. The screen for movies etc was not very responsive. Having said that, it was way better than American Airlines whom we flew to Salt Lake last year via Chicago.
"
"   London to Colorado Springs via Dallas. After reading the reviews, before my flight earlier this month, I was concerned to say the least. Dreading my upcoming flight almost. But, after having flown Delta to Colorado Springs in December 2016. I am pleased to be able to say the conditions on AA main cabin were as good as, if not better in one area, as Delta. I can't actually see the justification for bad reviews in main cabin. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The seat pitch was fine. I would go as far to say I feel like I had more leg room on AA than I did on Delta, but the seat width is noticeably less than other flights I've been on. Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you. I was contemplating paying extra for main cabin extra, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. I would save your money as I couldn't see any significant difference in leg room, although it's supposed to provide an additional 6 inches. I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable.  Not the best economy experience I've had, but acceptable. Cabin crew service was polite and friendly. Nothing really to comment on over and above what's expected. IFE was actually quite good. Lots of choice with current and classic movie choices. Overall. Not a bad experience. Certainly better than I expected."
"   London to New York. The flight was delayed by at least two hours due to inclement weather which you could understand and deal with but not unprofessional attitude of the staff. Actually it was just one member who proceeded on three, yes three occasions to ignore me while giving out drinks. Once for a cup of tea, again passed over when offering a bottle of water twice! I get that they need to stretch across to take the window seat person's tray but no excuse me, nothing! One other thing  was just before boarding it seemed a little chaotic as people were lining up and did not know which line or where it seemed to be going. The staff were waving you here there and everywhere. Perhaps putting large print signs with more concise info would be more helpful. Though the rating is on the low side, I would recommend this airline as my London to New York trip went fine but return one not so much."
"   Los Angeles to Auckland, returning from Sydney in Business Class. Boeing 787 to Auckland and Boeing 777 from Sydney. American long hauls across the Pacific are excellent. Got on the plane in LAX for late evening departure and warmly welcomed. Asked for PJ's and changed before we took off and put mattress pad on the seat. Promptly put the seat back after takeoff and enjoyed seven hours of sleep. Good breakfast and thanked crew for a great flight. Similar experience from Sydney on the 777. Crew were also very good through the whole flight. Meals, wines and movie selections were excellent. Would definitely recommend American on these legs."
"   Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. I paid for First Class and was treated worse than coach by the flight attendant. I initially asked for a cocktail and was told that I had to wait until she began serving drinks. No problem. When she finally did come to my seat she took my order very begrudgingly making faces as if she really want to starve me. After which, she served meals. I’m pescatarian, so I couldn’t eat any of the selections. I solicited her attention and asked if there were any Vegan meals, to which she angrily responded “NO”. On our descent, I really had to use the bathroom. She loudly stated that I needed to be seated because we were landing so I complied and returned to my seat. I calmly waited until the plane had taxied and the seatbelt light went off. The attendant rushed forward and said I had to sit down as I was closing the bathroom door. She continued to yell outside of the toilet. I don’t feel that American Airlines should continue to employ  employees who have their own agendas."
   Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. It is a real pity to watch one of the old mainline US carriers continue to fall to new lows. The aircraft broke down and needed to be replaced. The flight was the best part of 5 hours late. Inflight service and ground handling was ordinary. Once upon a time America lead the world with customer service. American Airlines staff seemed to be so demotivated that they really have little interest in their customers. The whole lack of a service culture seems to filter through the airline. They just don't care. This happens far too often and they risk long term customers like me moving their business elsewhere.
   Los Angeles to Great Falls via Salt Lake city. Flight delayed resulting in missed connection and adding hours to my travel time after already being in transit for 24 hours. Came off a code share flight from Australia. This is the 3rd change Delta Air Lines have made to my flight since booking last December. The staff here in Los Angeles have been uninterested and unhelpful to the point of rudeness
"   Los Angeles to Hong Kong. Boarded on time for 0155 departure. Sat in 3J a very private business class seat that has only one window. A large pillow, seat pad and duvet was on the seat. Slippers, a cole haan amenity kit and bottled water was in the side storage area. Pyjamas and predeparture drinks were offered. The dinner service was promptly started after departure. The quality of food was good and the flight attendants were attentive and checked on me throughout asking if I was ok or if I needed anything. Prior to arrival in HKG breakfast was served. Snacks were also available throughout the flight. I was pleasantly surprised with the comfort and service on this flight. My expectations weren't high, but this was every bit as good as my prior business cabin experiences on Qantas, ANA etc"
"   Los Angeles to London. Awful experience flying with American Airlines. Crew was reluctant to assist during check in, when passport scanners did not work. The seats are the smallest I have ever sat in, staff was unfriendly to passengers on numerous occasions (a male flight attendant on helping an older man with his luggage: “i can’t lift that”), overall they seem not to like their customers very much. On top of that it was very hot in the cabin and lastly, they only came around with drinks twice on a 10 hour flight. I will never fly with them again, if I can prevent it."
"   Los Angeles to Minneapolis. I am actually mad at myself that I have Delta another chance. This airline have frustrated me profoundly 2 times in the past. However, today I having the experience that will keep me from flying with this company ever again. Now is 8:30am during my summer in Los Angeles, no weather issues whatsoever and I have been waiting for my flight since 11:30pm yesterday and still don't know when I am going to be able to get in a plane. Probably at night. Incredibly rude, disorganized and careless service because their system were down the entire night. This is not a one time thing. Delta is a horrible company and you should avoid it."
"   Los Angeles to Orlando. I have had six flights in a row that have either been delayed or cancelled by American Airlines, and this entire time they never attributed a flying credit I had with them for any of my purchases. When I asked to prolong this credit (which was my own money and then cancelled with a free £200 for them), they refused to even prolong the one year lifespan of my refund. And this all comes after my extended patience with their utterly incompetent services, purchasing tickets for my crew members and all. American Airlines is not only the least reliable large airlines in the United States, they are also the least inconsiderate of their customers. I will never give them another dollar, and neither should you."
"   Los Angeles to Philadelphia. For over $500 roundtrip, you'd think you'd have in-flight entertainment, or a charging station, or the option to buy a meal, or the ability to cross your legs without banging the seat in front of you - but, no. None of the above was part of this horrendously uncomfortable experience. I'm finished with American. Sadly, I have to return on an American flight, but never again will I purchase tickets from this airline. I wonder if the CEO would enjoy the experience I just had of flying on an ancient, pre-modern era plane with no food (except disgusting snacks), no entertainment, no ability to charge a device so you can have enjoy own entertainment, and no leg-room."
"   Los Angeles to Philadelphia. I never got on the plane. I got my luggage on the plane. Security made me go back and get paper ticket. Security short cutted me to get me to gate on time. They delayed the flight. I went to desk and tried to talk to employee she told to go sit down.  Then she says there Overbooked and every one left had to catch next flight. I went to desk and I was promised i would be on next plane 6 hours later. And left in airport at 1am with no access to food or drinks to sleep on floor under my coat. 6am comes around. And nothing, overbooked again. Told to sit 15 hours for a chance of getting on plane. I asked them to book me with another airline that had seats available and left in an hour. They said they wouldn’t do it. I asked for a refund. They said no. Now they offer 25$ refund on 700 something tickets. Do not use this airline they will rip you off with no remorse. "
"   Los Angeles to Phoenix. I purchased the new American Airlines Economy class ticket. Little did I know what that really entailed. I pay $25 for my carry on luggage and head to the gate 2 hours early. My boarding group was Group 9. As they call each group, I walk closer and closer to the gate. At Group 7, they close the gate. I was standing there with 8 other people in Group 9 and the man walks up to us and tells us the gate is closed. They never called last boarding, and never called our group! We were told we were ""late"". We were sent to customer service. As I walked up to customer service, the women closed the rope on me and told me she was off duty and someone else will show up. The Manager arrives and continues to tell me and the 8 other passengers that it was our fault that we were late to the gate and that was why they left without us. Customer service tells me she will place us on standby for the next flight. We get on the bus to the next terminal and race to catch the next flight. When I get there, the person at the desk tells me that I will not be getting on the flight. Customer service sent all of us to another terminal to catch a flight she knew we would never get on! As I try to explain to the man what happened, he shuts me up and tells me there is nothing he can do. I raise my voice out of frustration and he calls the security to tell me to leave the terminal right away. I leave the airport and head to the main check in. I tell them my story and she tells me that she will put me on the next flight in the morning and I will make that flight. I Uber home and wake up at 3AM to catch the 5:30 AM flight. I'm the last to be called for the standby and I start boarding the plan. the women stops me as I'm walking onto the plane and tells me I have to get off and there is no more room. Not even an apology, nothing. Grabs my arm and tells me I have to get off there is no more room. Tells me I have to stand in line and wait to find out if I can get on the next one.  I get told I will not get on the next flight. I ended up renting a car and driving to PHX. When I went to baggage claim, the women was very nice and asked what had happened in LAX with those flights because there seemed to be many other people with my same problem who had to end up driving."
"   Los Angeles to San Jose return on Delta Air Lines. Both sectors were operated by refitted neat and clean Boeing 757-200. Check in fast and friendly. LAX Delta Club not bad. However, DL provides no lounge for business pax in SJO. Both flights on time. Fantastic professional and friendly crew on board. They could not do enough for pax. IFE was excellent. The only criticism was the food. However, have had worse. Baggage was out fast in LAX and SJO. Price paid was competitive and worth every bit."
"   Los Angeles to Shanghai PVG. I just encountered the absolute worst check-in and security I have ever experienced. We were at the American Airlines terminal at LAX. They insisted we checked in using machines, none of which worked for us.  When we went to a desk the lady behind the encounter was rude and accused us of using the machines incorrectly.  We were given seats not next to each other for our 13.5 hour flight. When we asked if we could sit next to each other the woman told us it didn't matter we'd just have to ask people to swap with us or we would have to pay a minimum of $150 per person to change seats to be together.  We went to complain and got sent to the priority check in desk. When we explained the situation, the person behind this desk said aggressively that the seats must all be sold out except the extra leg room seats. When I said the other person hadn't said these seats were extra leg room, just that we had to pay to sit together, she told me I must have heard her wrong or misunderstood her. The priority desk person then threw our passports and boarding passes on the counter and said aggressively ""you're all set"", when I asked ""what do you mean"" she rose her voice and said ""I put you guys together!"" and gave a shooing motion towards us with her hand. No apologies, no explanations. We the continued to the American Airlines security area, put our things in boxes and queued up to go through. A security person, again aggressively shouted at people saying ""you have to stay with your boxes"", so my boyfriend and I stayed in the queue to go through next to our boxes about a foot away. The same person then came very close to my face and said ""Miss is that your box?"" To which I responded ""yes"". He then said condescendingly ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" I didn't understand the question because in every other airport you put your box in the row and staff make sure it goes through the machine for you. So I looked at him confused at which point he aggressively pointed at the box and me and shouted ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" At which point I felt really intimidated and said ""I am?"" Then he said ""exactly. Then get over there."" I felt humiliated.  So I got on the queue and walked in to the body scanner when called, stood on the yellow feet on the floor then the next security person again with horrible attitude said ""did you got through pre-security?"" I looked back saw there was nothing else behind me but the area I had just been shouted at in and said ""yes."" He then said sarcastically ""you look like you're wearing sandals"". Clearly I was. So I said ""yes"". He then said in an accusatory, rude voice ""you were supposed to take them off and put them through the x-ray scanner"" and gave me a shooing motion so I returned to the x-ray scanner, put my shoes in a box and got back in the queue. Just to clarify there were no signs or messages saying you needed to push your boxes or take off your sandals. The whole experience left me feeling awful. There are plenty of far better, cheap airline carriers out there. "
"   Los Angeles to Sydney. Delta had a 3x3x3 layout in economy class on this Boeing 777 on this flight from LA to Sydney. I had an economy comfort seat, which features more legroom and slightly more recline, both valuable assets on a 14 hours flight. The seat was comfortable, and I could catch some sleep. The service was decent. However, the food was rather sub-standard. I had a tasteless cheese ravioli dish. At least, I cannot complain regarding the amount of food available: Delta served a snack in the middle of the flight (sandwich, apple, cookie) and breakfast (French toast). Furthermore, they had a snack bar where you could serve yourself during the flight."
"   Manchester to Boston via New York. I am disgusted by the way Delta treat their customers. My wife and I booked through Virgin a return flight Manchester to Boston via New York. Besides the flight being cancelled from New York to Boston their staff were non existent. We arrived in New York delayed but with a time that was tight as you have to go through security and immigration. After panicking a little we found the flight was delayed. We set off to the boarding gate. I am disabled and require a mobility scooter to get around so I was waiting patiently for Delta member of staff to check us out as usual. This never happened. To cut a long story short the flight while we sat waiting was delayed four time was coming from two different Airports and then cancelled. We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim. On arriving there we asked about the bags and we were refused. We went to the taxi stand and tried to find the taxi company asking one of the drivers he was not easy to understand he said it was his taxi. I was put in the back by means of ramps and I only just got in. The taxi driver did not know where the hotel was my wife caught a glimpse of it and showed it to the driver. Arriving at the hotel he wanted another voucher for the return journey next day. We did not have one. We ordered a taxi through the hotel, as I could not go through that again costing $40. Arriving at JFK we proceeded to the gate and guess what another delay. I thought here we go again. At the new take off time an hour delay there was further discussion as to how they would handle my mobility scooter and after one member of staff who seemed to be the group leader refusing to load it as they had not been trained. After a long discussion I was allowed to go to the Aircraft doors and my scooter was taken away. My thoughts were I was never going to see it again. I was directed to a seat,which was difficult to get in due to my disability and then found my wife was seated elsewhere. We arrived at Boston and went to retrieve our cases and found they were not there. My wife thought she spotted them some way from the area and sure enough it was them. We were then told that they had come on an earlier flight. It would of been helpful and customer focused to tell us that in the beginning The return flight was also a nightmare but I am not in mood to go on as it gets me more angry by the thought of it"
"   May 11th 2017 DL1218, Atlanta to Los Angeles. Great service from three flight attendants who handled a medical emergency on board. Passenger behind me had a seizure and they were calm, listened to my direction (I'm a RN) and very professional. Thank you Delta Air Lines."
"   Melbourne Fl to Rochester NY via Atlanta. I came back from my cruise way early, like 9.30am and my wife and I were waiting for a 5.50pm flight. The attendant suggested we get on a standby list for an earlier flight so we did. Well we flew out early at 11.24am! Then we got to Atlanta and all went to hell. Delta offered us 1 seat (split us up) on the next early flight not 2 (1 for each of us) so we asked if there was any other way and they said nope, nothing we can do. I asked about our checked bags and was told they would stay here until we depart at 9.20pm, 8.5 hours after landing. At 5pm I got an alert that my luggage was at my final destination while I was still in Atlanta. So after going round and round with this screw up on Delta's end, I'm about to get on the 9.20pm flight with no luggage and not even an apology from them. When I asked about an upgrade they said they can't do that. Horrible customer service, I'm flying Southwest from now on."
"   Memphis to Atlanta. This is a terrible airline if I am being completely honest. I have been rebooked 3 times, I have waited in the airport for over 9 hours for my flight to be rebooked due to weather. Because of weather they do not put you up in a hotel, so I have paid for my own hotel for 2 nights now.  No other airline has delays or cancellations in the country either, other airlines are going to the same places that I am and are still going."
   Memphis to Houston via Dallas. This review is about American Airlines customer service and about the experience I have had with requesting a refund. I made a reservation using a evoucher but I cancelled the reservation within 24 hrs. I requested a refund and I learned that I would have to wait up to 2 weeks to receive it by mail. Two weeks later I check the refund status on AA website and see that a letter has been mailed to me but I never received this letter. Ive called customer service inquiring about this 3 separate times and spent over 3 hours and waiting over 2 months and still not received my refund. So I have to say that American Airlines has the worst refund process. I dont know when I will receive my refund.
"   Memphis to Las Vegas via Phoenix. Excellent customer service and professional flight attendants. There was a lady sitting in my assigned window seat. When I told her it was my seat, she would not move. I confirmed my seat with flight attendant and she advised the lady that her seat was in the next row and the lady still refused to move. I sat in another seat and explained it was no big deal. The FA said thank you so much and gave me a bag of snacks for my patience and kindness! She handled the situation smoothly and very professional."
"   Miami to Albany. I don’t even know where to start with this airline company. I have dealt with issues since booking my flights for my honeymoon. The customer service is horrible! The first issue I dealt with when booking was over the phone. We wanted to switch our flights to a different time so we wouldn’t miss our cruise ship. The flight we had originally booked was cutting it close. Ended up finding another flight (price was less than we paid) when we went to change the flights I had to deal with about 15 different people trying to tell me that I needed to pay more money for switching the flight. After days and numerous people we ended up just booking and paying the extra money. Be careful because if you go On the site and show that you’re looking at a flight the price will raise from when you first looked at it. Next issue was coming home we arrived to the Miami airport. Checking into the flight the day before we got on our boarding passes a certain area to board. When we got to the airport, they changed the gate again and gave us paper boarding passes, then it got close to boarding time and we realized no one was boarding. So I looked on the app and it gave us another area so we rushed there realizing that was also the wrong gate. Our gate for changed 4 different times without being notified. So we ended up Missing our flight. The gate was on the other side of the airport. When talking to the customer service about switching our flight they were very rude telling us that their was nothing they could do and it was our fault that we didn’t know. Never an apology or anything reassurance they were going to help us get home safe. Customer service is horrible with this company. I can’t even believe what I have dealt with. I will never fly American Airlines again."
"   Miami to Boston. Bought flight a month ago but when we we checking in they overbook the flight. I am travelling with my fiance and now we have to travel separately. First of all, they don't even want to explain to you whats going in? They just say one sec, one sec, and we have been here since 8am and they have been saying one sec, one second, and at 8:50am they decided to give us a seat without letting us know that we have to travel separate. We did not even get chance to grab the food because they dont want to give you information. Not happy about it. Never again flying with American Airlines. "
"   Miami to Bradley. I will never fly this airline again. I cannot believe how terrible our flight experience has been. They offer nothing in comparison to other airlines (wifi, charging portles, accommodating staff, seat comfort). I had to measure the suitcase that I've been traveling with and carrying on for eight years, five separate times! As I was boarding l had to measure the suitcase again and was forced to check it. No wonder all of these reviews are negative. I wish I read them before I booked!"
"   Miami to Cancun. Very disappointed at the airline. Not family oriented. Traveled with my wife and three kids 3, 4, 7 and they gave us separate seats. After talking to a lady at the gate they where able to seat my wife with two of my kids. However my 4 year old was seated by himself with two other people that he did not know. Finally we have to seat our 3, 4 and 7 years old by themselves. I can't comprehend how American Airlines think within their standards this is safe and not a liability. What would happen in case of an emergency? How can I protect my kids if something would happen?"
"   Miami to Charleston. American Airlines used to understand customer service. The customer service supervisor at the baggage desk at the Miami airport on Monday night, 11/6/2017 told me that it was not her fault I was stupid. I may not be a genius, but is that customer service, or appropriate management terminology towards customers? If you want service that is less satisfactory than robots, apparently American Airlines is for you. I’ve never been so disrespected in an airport in my 30 years of air travel. "
   Miami to Houston. I found the flight to be most enjoyable. Refreshments were available for purchase. No problems were encountered.with either the check in or the flight itself. Miami airport is a great airport to fly out of.
"   Miami to London Heathrow. My first flight with American Airlines and hopefully my last. The check in agent was reasonably okay. The cabin crew on the whole totally disinterested and disengaged. No cabin crew awareness of good customer service. A poor meal service, and they did not offer water during the transatlantic flight, too much interest in bonding I think."
"   Miami to Los Angeles. Excellent, fresh new plane (the flagship aircraft for AA). Was able to snag a biz class seat by requesting an upgrade about 2-3 months in advance. 15J is right near the window with reasonable privacy. Fully lie-flat seat with a mirror and an amenity kit. A huge plus were the Bose noise-cancelling headphones. The pillow was okay, blanket was great. The meal service was excellent - salad to start with warm nuts, great wine choices (I sampled the two whites) and a sea bass entree with pesto rice and carrots. The signature hot fudge sundae followed. The service was polite without being spectacular. I was able to take a nap just before we landed into LA (beautiful sunset landing). One of the few negatives: my laptop charger could not charge in the socket (perhaps due to its bulky size)."
"   Miami to Nashville. My husband and I were returning home from our wedding/ Honeymoon in St. Lucia on Flight AA4658 from Miami to Nashville and I was carrying my very expensive wedding dress on the plane. I had called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be a problem to hang it up before we left and was told that the flight attendant would help us find a place for my dress. We had been on four flights and on all of our flights except the last the flight attendants were helpful and polite. Our last flight was an absolute nightmare and everyone with us is very displeased with how poorly we were treated. The flight attendant introduced herself and she was extremely rude and condescending. Entering the plane we encountered the FA and asked if there was a place we could hang my wedding dress? She in return asked where we were seating, so we told her seats 12A and 12C. She curtly told us that because we were not flying first class she could not help us and we would have to put the dress in one of the overhead compartments. I was appalled by how dismissive she was. We quietly took our seats but I absolutely refused to shove my expensive dress above with all the other luggage, so we held the dress in our laps. Another flight attendant from the back came to greet us and was very sweet. She asked about the dress and we told her what happened. I told her how upset I was and she told us she would take care of it. A few moments later we saw her call up to the other flight attendant and it look like they were in a very heated altercation. Eventually the other flight attendant placed the dress in a hanging closed, but from that point on the first FA was even more rude than she was when we first entered the plane. Anytime she would walk by us she would make condescending remarks. When we were exiting the plane and asked for the dress she yet again make uncalled for remarks. We reached out to American airlines to complain about her unacceptable way of treating people, but we were only given a very generic cookie cutter response. We don't feel that American Airlines values customers that are not in their programs and we will not fly with them in the future."
"   Miami to New York JFK. My experience with the American Airlines flight AA1048 (1 June 2017) was by far the worst experience I have had with any airline. Flight AA1048 was delayed over 4 hours (scheduled departure time was supposedly 3:30pm from Miami and arriving at JFK at 6:30pm), which resulted to my boyfriend and I not making our connecting flight to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. We ended up departing Miami airport at 7:30pm and arriving at JFK at 10:10pm at terminal 8. Our flight back home was scheduled to depart at 10:45pm at terminal 4 with Etihad Airlines. The staff at American Airlines (both at Miami and the JFK airport) had no concept of urgency, sensitivity or care to its passengers. Gate changes were made without clear announcements (D4 to D23) and passengers were not informed in a timely manner about reasons for the flight delay. Sporadic announcements were made when it was clear that passengers were becoming even more restless and agitated as their patience was being stretched beyond their capacity. One bit of information that was announced was that the plane was ready to leave however, the cabin crew was waiting for one flight attendant who was running late. This was actually ridiculous considering the flight was already late for 3 hours and she was still late.  I do acknowledge that the pilot informed us in a timely manner the reasons for the further and ongoing delay, which was nice. Furthermore, I do also acknowledge his amazing pilot skills steering us through the crazy turbulence and landing the plane in such a smooth and gentle way.  AA staff at JFK were rude, abrupt and showed no courtesy. After the plane landed, my boyfriend and I tried to get off the flight as soon as possible and when we managed to get through to the gate front desk, I spoke to a lady explaining to her that my boyfriend and I had a flight in 45min but she just brushed us off and said that since we didn't book the connecting flight with AA, there's nothing they can do. I asked her if it was possible if she could call the other terminal to notify them that we were on the way and she just said, ""Nope we can't do that and there's no way and that we missed our flight considering the time involved with baggage claim"". We asked her how to get to terminal 4 and what was the fastest way and she just advised ""go up that way and follow the signs"" in her monotone. She provided no equitable solution, not even extended a small kind gesture to appease our frustration as it was clear she did not understand the concept of customer service. "
"   Miami to New York JFK. Only after 3 hours of delay, Delta reported a problem with the airplane and started the maintenance and 7-8 hours after the original boarding time we finally board. We waited 2 hours with not even water in a hot aircraft when they announced that the crew was working for too long and they asked us to get off the plane. Only one person from Delta was outside but he didn't know how to explain anything. At the end I left the airport after 12 hours and was not even offered any voucher or transport. I lost one day at the airport. Spent a lot of money with food, transportation, hotel and didn't get paid for the event I was working. Delta offered me $100, which I didn't accept."
"   Miami to New York. I will never fly with American Airlines again.  I've been flying with them the last 10 years but the mistreatment of my last flight this morning, I won’t give this airline another penny! From the service when it was time to board my flight, the staff were so rude."
"   Miami to Orlando. From the boarding to the customer service and service in general is terrible. The new machines they have to get your boarding passes was not working. Once I rushed out of one American airline flight to get to my connecting flight was delayed by 3 hours mind you I'm trying to rush to not miss it. I arrive to the gate they say they are delayed because the staff is overworked and they are waiting on new staff, which to me is ridiculous and makes no sense. Once almost 4 hours passed they call us to board the plane, a rude lady was giving everyone attitude and was upset for whatever reason and did not want to answer questions. So now at this moment we are on the airplane waiting to depart and waiting on the runway for 30 mins - at this point we are delayed by 4.5 hours for a flight that only takes 30 Mins. And to top it off they made a mistake with the number of passengers and paper work so here goes an extra 30 mins. I do not recommend this airline whatsoever. "
"   Miami to Raleigh Durham. At the boarding, the attendant determined my carry-on needed to be checked stating that my bag was big, to which I replied that I always use the same carry-on and it was extremely lightweight. Then she stated that there was not enough space in cabin, and she checked my carry-on. I entered the plane and to my surprise there were plenty  of empty room across the plane and on top and front of my seat #28, more than two compartments empty near me! This situation is unpleasant, uncomfortable and shows lack respect for customers who as myself, prepare in advance for a faster way of moving between airports."
"   Miami to San José. Outbound flight on time, but bags were very slow to show on the belt. Return flight left an hour late due to the crew being held up in traffic in SJO. This was a bit surprising as traffic problems in SJO are not exactly difficult to predict, but they did make up lmost of the lost time. Plentty of space and the seat was comfortable, but the food on both sectors was unappetising, particularly breakfast on the return which featured a dried out ham omelette smothered in tomato sauce."
"   Miami to Santo Domingo. Every time I fly with American Airlines, i feel there is something that frustrates me. This time, they asked me to check a bag when clearly it could have fit. They wanted to argue with me saying it wouldn't and when I got on the plane there were bags larger then mine. I was just in a smaller plane before and travel all the time with my bag and it always fits in the overhead. Last time I flew with American in January, the plane never showed up and I had to wait in the airport from my original destination for 7 hours. I missed my next flight and american did nothing to help me except for giving me food vouchers that covers nothing in an airport. I had to get a hotel in the airport and spend an extra 145$. I find myself more and more disappointed with American Airlines every time I fly."
"   Miami to Seattle via Phoenix. They canceled my flight out of Miami which was 55 hours before Irma hit Miami. So when they canceled me and 80% of the rest of their flights at a time when other airlines were scrambling to get people out of harms way, there were no options left. Thousands of people stranded with a category 5 coming. They charged me $745 to change my flight. They booked, canceled, rebooked, canceled, rebooked 4 times. On the day I finally got out of Miami, Wednesday, 3 days after the storm, AA had canceled 81% of their flights.  My flight was not canceled, but it was 3 hours late because there were no attendants. 81% of their flights are canceled and they couldn't have a crew ready for my flight. Never  will I give them my money."
"   Miami to Washington Dulles. Was supposed to depart at 8:40am, something about a log blog not being in the plane so we waited until 10:30am to leave. I feel it shouldn't have taken that long and should have been noticed way before we boarded the plane. Plus side we got a snack, but as the vegan wrap was disgusting."
"   Miami to Washington. I was upset to find that I had to check my carry on, last minute! They literally looked at my bag and my girlfriends bag, and slapped a sticker saying ""there is no more cabin area for your luggage"". All the while, there was plenty of space for our two carry on and then some. If you going to own an airline and operate one, you should take in to account how much space and what can be brought on the plane, accordingly. Not when you are walking on to the plane. I didn't have any of my belongings with me and yes I am a female and yes I did not have proper items when needed. This was hands down the worst experience and from such a big corporation."
"   Milwaukee to Calgary via Minneapolis. Three of the four flights were inordinately delayed, not because of weather which I would have understood given the season, but because of mechanical problems. The departure time from Milwaukee was constantly pushed back -- to an extent that we missed the connecting flight at Minneapolis. I was assured when the first delay was announced that we would make the connection with the new timing. This happened a second time. We were willing to cancel our tickets and take flights on alternative airlines. But the gate agents were not able to be honest about the actual departure time -- in fact, they said they were only the messengers of the news. In the event, we lost the entire day travelling and reached our destination so late that we had to arrange for alternative transportation because we had missed our previously booked non-refundable transfers -- not to mention the holiday activities we had planned that afternoon and evening. It started our holiday on a very bad note. On the return, early morning flight was delayed for mechanical reasons. However we reached Minneapolis in time to connect. But the connecting flight after travelling down the runaway, gathering speed, suddenly braked and returned to the gate - mechanical problems. An alternative plane was arranged and we reached home several hours later. The ground manager asked us to rate them high for having arranged a replacement plane -- what gall! When you have 3 out of 4 flights on the same type of aircraft of the same airline experience mechanical problems, we have to be very concerned about the maintenance standards and competencies at Delta Airlines. Unfortunately, on many routes we have to put up with this airline as there are no alternatives."
"   Minneapolis to Fayetteville via Charlotte. Before catching the flight in Charlotte, in the last moment they have informed that the flight has been downgraded and 3 people doesn't have enough space. They didn't check for the priority. I am not sure on what basis they have stopped the 3 travelers out of all economy travelers. All 3 were Indians. They were not ready to arrange any other flight. The only flight which is available in AA is next day morning. They said they will arrange accommodation. But they have given a single room for all 3 of us. When i checked with manager to give separate rooms, he said it will be provided in the hotel. But when we reached there it was only 1 single double room and of us had to sleep on the floor. This is the very worst case I have ever seen with the airlines. They should consider the priorities before taking decisions. I would suggest not to take this airline. "
"   Minneapolis to Guangzhou via Detroit and Beijing, returning from Beijing via Detroit. Departing flight was fine, Delta spend a few more bucks for better food, refreshments, and bottled water was generously given out. This made a 13 hour flight more pleasant. The downside was the arrival at Guangzhou on a China Southern Airlines domestic flight, had to depart plane only to get herded into a stand up bus, then to door to get luggage. It was hot, and after a 26 hour flight time makes one grumpy. Return was fair, food was fair. Real downside was a delayed departure from Beijing to Detroit and then boarding the plane in Detroit to Minneapolis to be treated rudely by attendant for being late after I practically ran from getting my luggage to go through customs then to the boarding gate. The late departure was Delta's fault, faulty equipment. Several times I have witnessed passengers treated this way going to Minneapolis on the night flight."
"   Minneapolis to Iron Mountain. My flight was cancelled and the Delta employee was amazingly patient and caring with figuring out the best route for each person on the cancelled flight. People were crying and upset but she held it together and did not get frustrated with anyone. She did an outstanding job and probably deserves to be paid way more than she is being paid. On the flight that I got switched to, all the staff were equally as helpful and patient. Delta hires good employees and this counts them as a trustworthy company in my opinion. If you have flight problems, Delta will take care of you well."
"   Minneapolis to San Jose. When I got to the airport I was running late. I was actually too late to check my bags so I went to the front counter to see what my alternatives were. The woman who helped me was amazing. She had said that there was no way to get my bags on the flight so she would have to switch my flights. She worked it out so that I only got into San Jose 9 min later that I would have with my first flight and I was seated in an exit row! People say that the American Airlines staff doesn't care, but that has never been my experience with this airline."
"   Minneapolis to Seattle. From 5 star to zero in moments. That first statement speaks to my recent Delta Air Lines experience. It started with one of the best flights on Delta Air Lines where I flew from cancun to Minneapolis. The captains of the plane struck up conversation before boarding and were very friendly. When we boarded the flight attendants asked our names, where we were from and treated us like gold. But, then we got to Minneapolis. We asked politely if there were any upgrades available and the gate agent answered the most condescending ""you do that when you book. Who told you that you could come here and ask me for this?!"" I was stunned. Not just stunned frankly insulted and angered. Paying customers should never be treated with such contempt and outright disgust. Delta who claims to put there customers first in this instance treated us like mere nuisances. This will definitely impact my decision whether or not to fly Delta in the future. To make matters worse I saw the same gate agent treating other customers with attitude, contempt and disgust."
"   Minneapolis to Tampa via Charlotte. I asked for a blanket to the flight attendant, she said ""blankets are only for first class"". I could see many blankets store on the top compartments of the plane that no one was using. Does that make sense? When did we lose our humanity?  Everyone should have the right to have a blanket, specially if there are many not being used."
"   Monroe, LA to Orlando, FL via Atlanta, GA. Although my flight was booked 3 months in advance with a 1 hour layover in Atlanta, Delta changed the itinerary to leave me with a 4 hour layover and a significantly delayed arrival at my final destination. On the return trip home, I was on time, but their plane was not. By the time I arrived (once again in Atlanta) there were only seven minutes to catch a connecting flight. I sprinted through the airport to arrive 3 minutes short. The answer from the sarcastic Delta representative - they may be able to place me on standby for a flight leaving in a few hours, but I should probably start checking out hotels. Nice! I am disappointed with their poor logistical planning and lack of professionalism. To top matters off, my suitcase was damaged. If you want to arrive at your location when expected, try another airline! Just because I'm flying into Orlando, that doesn't mean I want a Mickey Mouse operation getting me there."
"   Montevideo to Miami. Overall a very good experience. Check in nice staff on the ground. Lounge Access at Montevideo. Boarding on time, grups, all well done. Once on board very nice FA. Seat configuration on the Boeing 767 it`s very comfortable. Seat with lots of personal space, flat bed, comfy blanket and pillow. Tablet for IFE lots of chices. Food selection ok, and wines very good. The FA were great, and the flight departed just on time, arrived 15 min early at the gate. Great flight."
   Montreal to Miami. First of all they charge to check in your luggage and whats even more ridiculous is that they charge extra if your suitcase is over 50 pounds. I paid to check in my suitcase who cares about  weight.  Once I got to my gate they said the overhead was full so I had to check in my carry on. I wasn't too happy. They promised me the overhead was full and there was no way around it. I finally caved and complained so they didn't charge me. So I basically would have paid to check in my first suitcase for nothing. When I got in the airplane at my seat I noticed they completely lied to me and the overheads were practically empty. The seats have cheap covers on them I'm not impressed!!
"   Munich to San Diego via Detroit. After reading all the reviews I had set the bar very low. As it turns out flying with them was painless. Seats were comfortable, although the domestic leg offered more leg room and a newer entertainment system than international. The staff although older than most carriers I've flown were friendly and professional. Selection of shows to watch was extensive with a very wide range to please most tastes. The only real down sides is that the touch screens on the 767 old and didn't respond that well. The other being the cold cabin on the international legs. The food offered was quite good. As far as the punctuality goes all flights left on time and arrived early."
"   My family was returning home from a wonderful vacation that included a Cruise. We arrived at Ontario, CA airport 09.30 pm for a flight departing at 11.59 pm. Upon arrival my sister dropped me off at the terminal with our luggage and proceeded to return rental car. The American Skycap helped me get the luggage inside when I started to tip him, I discovered my wallet and phone were missing. Firstly the skycap called my sister continuously with no reply (kudos to him). I was panicked as you may imagine, my next contact was a very knowledgeable and caring ticket agent. She picked up her phone and tried to reach Hertz who did not answer her many phone calls on my behalf, then called airport police. Officer also attempted to contact Hertz with no avail. Finally, my sister arrived and went back to Hertz and the car and found my wallet and phone, all was well. I want to say a huge thank you to our ticket agent who also checked us in, for everything she did. When we reached the gate the agent they knew my name and asked if I had found my wallet. Kudos to the entire Ontario, CA Int, staff and especially to our American Airlines ticket agent."
"   My first and last time with American Airlines. Flew from Seattle to Fayetteville, Arkansas via Dallas Ft. Worth. Flight attendants were extremely unhelpful. Plane was 25 minutes late despite having been parked at the gate for 2+ hours prior to take off. Gate agent was late getting to the gate to let crew onto aircraft and get us boarded. 25 minutes late getting into DFW. No connecting flight information was given by flight crew. Our connecting flight boarding passes had the wrong gate listed. When we landed I asked an agent at the gate to call the gate of our connecting flight to let them know, she said she couldn't do that but told us we should hurry. My 75 year old father and I ran through the airport only to have the gate agent at our connecting flight litterally close the door in our face and tell us there was nothing she could do to get us on the plane. The next flight was 2 hours later, which made us late for our meeting. I am most disturbed by the lack of customer service and unhelpful nature of all the employees we encountered."
"   My flight was cancelled from Hong Kong to LAX. I understand this happens and is often out of control of the airline. However, the organisation at the airport was awful as there is no American Airlines desk in Hong Kong airport so a lot of waiting around with nobody telling us what was going to happen. I had two onward flights to catch, one connecting from LAX-JFK with American Airlines and one the following day with JetBlue. As the delay got pushed back further and further (more than 15hrs) with the first leg, it turned out I was missing both connections. I called up AA and they would offer no compensation for this delay. At this point I had paid a change of flight fee to JetBlue and had paid for a hotel in New York. In the end, after not backing down, they said they would issue me a $300 voucher for use on AA. However, they will only issue the voucher by post. 8 weeks went by, no voucher. I've spoken to them and they told me they cannot give it out electronic vouchers by email because I do not have US address (come on..what year is this?), so I am still waiting. Overall I experienced pretty appalling service."
"   My flight was supposed to be such a short trip, that is why I chose to fly instead of drive from Seattle to Spokane. Both flights were majorly delayed on my trip and it defeated the purpose of flying. In addition to that, it seemed very prominent with the crew that this is a regular thing. When I go onto the plane, the overhead bins barely fit my carry on purse. I had to fly with my carry on underneath my feet. With all the delay and keeping us at the airport so long, you think they would at least hand out pretzels or water. Nope. Terrible schedule and service. I will never be flying Delta again. Should have flown Alaska. They had a Spokane to Seattle flight scheduled for later than mine - that arrived in Seatac before my Delta flight did."
"   My husband and I came from Detroit airport and we spent almost 10 days in New York. We didn't have any problems coming to New York but today we arrived at La Guardia airport very early and we went to the main line to try to get an early flight back home. The woman was extremely rude. My husband asked for an early flight and she pretended not to hear him and started doing our check-in for the regular flight. He asked her again if she was doing a check-in for the earliest flight and she answered him rudely with a ironic smile saying that we had to pay more for that flight. Even before she told us the price for the flight change, she finished checking us in when, my husband asked her how much was the fare if we wanted to get the earlier flight and again she gave us the ironic face telling us the price while handing us the tickets. I believe that every person that works a job when they need to be in contact with others, they must learn how to be polite and be respectful to whoever they are dealing with."
"   My return journey from Orlando to London via Chicago was a journey from hell and very disappointing experience. I wasn't even notified of my delayed flight from Orlando and I was re-routed via Dallas Ft Worth instead. I urged the agent to book me on the direct flight to London on British Airways but she refused saying it was full. I later found out that that wasn't true and there was plenty of seats available at the gate. Flight to DFW was also delayed which meant I missed my connection in DFW. I was stuck there for a whole day, and missed a day at work. No accommodation was offered. The flight from DFW to LHR was depressing. They ran out of meals so was served a sandwich instead. I was told I need to pre-order next time! I explained that I was re-routed and had no choice. To top it up, my bags were delayed too. Everything that can possibly go wrong went wrong. I don't think I ever had an on time departure with American Airlines. Very depressing"
"   My son is in the military in Killeen Tx, he has a four day weekend coming up and wants to come visit. I purchased his tickets from Killeen to Panama City (United) for August 31 and the return trip on Delta for September 4th. Unfortunately Harvey happened and United had to cancel his outgoing flight to Panama City. I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund. My son only had that 4 day available to come visit, yet Delta was very proud that they were willing to waive the change fee, and were gracious to give me a credit that could be used anytime before August 2018. I told them that the only reason I had to cancel the flight was because my son will not be in Florida, it only makes sense that if he is not here he cannot board a plane here. I was also informed that if I did not call Delta back on September 4th to cancel his reservation I would be charged a no show fee (funny how me being on the phone (with both Delta and Justfly for a total of 4hrs, did not qualify as notice that he would not be on the return trip, of a trip he cannot take!). I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future. Unfortunately Delta is not that type of provider, so if you are reading this review I suggest that maybe you shop elsewhere just in case (god forbid) a similar situation happens and you are stuck not able to get your money back. I am sure that Delta will be enjoying a very nice self appreciation party on my dime. No compassion or empathy for their customers."
"   My university booked 45 people on a flight from New York JFK to Santiago, Chile, with a layover in Miami. When we arrived at the airport (luckily with plenty of time), the kiosks could not process our confirmation code and many of us got error codes. Customer service slowly and painfully manually checked us all in and took our luggage. When returning from Santiago, we arrived at the airport ready to encounter the same issue. This time, the kiosks once again did not work, but the customer assistance agent would not let us all enter the line to get manually checked in. Instead, they roped off the entrance to the EMPTY line and ""had to talk to the manager first."" We explained that there were 45 people under one reservation code and the kiosks would not check us in, but they were adamant about having each of us wait for the kiosk to give us an error code and then get in line for customer service. I explained that we would all miss our flight if all of us had to wait in line for a kiosk, error code, and then for customer assistance. After ""talking to the manager,"" the agent offered to check half of us in, not that this makes any sense because all 45 of us had a ticket number to board the same plane. Finally, after ignoring the agent and just entering the line, our bus driver came to argue with them as well to let the rest of the group through. The agents denied that 45 could possibly be under one confirmation code and have a group reservation (Why else would 45 people show up at the airport together?). Eventually, they let everyone through, did not find more agents to assist the line, and clearly had not communication amongst themselves. Luckily, everyone got through security in time for the flight, but I'm sure if some of us hadn't just ignored them all together, some would not have. The woman also printed my first boarding pass twice instead of printing my boarding pass for both legs of the trip, thank god the kiosk before security during my layover worked, or I would have missed my connecting flight since there were no attendees at the counter in Miami."
"   My wife and I flew Delta Air Lines from HNL to NRT. We booked on Expedia and a day before the flight we got an email reminder showing our seats, etc. We had booked our seats so we were sitting together. Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, we found ourselves sitting in middle seats in different rows. I explained that my wife was pregnant with morning sickness and it would be great if they could at least switch her to a seat in the aisle. But both the girl at check-in and the guy at the gate said they had no seats for us to change to and that we couldn't upgrade. ""Fine,"" I thought, ""sucks for us, but if they have a full plane then there's nothing they can do about it."" The really upsetting thing is that after boarding we saw that there were many seats open just a few rows in front and behind us. Luckily there was a couple sitting next to us that had been similarly split up and we ended up switching with them so we could both sit with our spouses. I don't know what the deal with Delta seat selection is, but given that they couldn't even accommodate my pregnant wife when there were so many empty seats made this our last Delta flight ever. P.S. I found crumbs on my tray table from the previous flight. Also, the touch screen for my entertainment was broken (It responded to about 1 out of every 10 times I touched it).

"   My wife and I were delayed in the Jacksonhole runway because the airline was running late with de-icing solution. This caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connection in Dallas. We ran across the Dallas airport and made it in time to see our plane and have another passenger who made it to the gate after us to be let on board. American told us that the system would not let us in but they let the other passenger on board because he had others in his party on board. We also had two in our party that made it on the plane 1 minute before us but they paid no attention to that detail for us. I have over 50,000 miles with American and don't think I can ever fly with them again after being treated this way. Customer service reps are a bunch of robots and totally insensitive to their customers needs."
"   My wife and were traveling to the Falkland islands and for the most part American Airlines had the best itinerary. The outward trip was nice on the 737 to Miami, then things changed. Miami to Santiago on an antiquated interior on a 777, flight staff not even cracking a smile, the worst airline food I ever had. Return journey, same only the food was a little better. Miami to Chicago, this 767 still had ashtrays in the arm rests plus a grubby interior, I did not feel safe on this aircraft. You need to update your fleet and improve the cosmetic maintenance of your aircraft and do something to make your staff happy, great is certainly not where you are headed!"
"   Myrtle Beach to Baltimore Washington via Charlotte. Daughter arrived at Charlotte gate E22 to connect to a flight to BWI. She was escorted to gate E24 and was told her flight to BWI would be departing from E24. She notified me via text that she was at gate E24. The AA flight status information on the app, website, and airport monitor noted flight AA2018 to BWI was departing from gate C10. She was left at the wrong gate. With less than 20 minutes to get to the correct gate and make flight AA2018, I called her and instructed her to speak to an AA rep at the counter that AA flight status information noted gate C10 and ask why she was at gate E24. AA reps then rushed my daughter to the correct gate. AA was paid an unaccompanied minor fee, however my daughter would have missed the flight had it not been for parental intervention to get her to the correct gate. I sent a letter to the VP of AA requesting a refund of unaccompanied minor fee. I received a response denying the refund stating ""she was still properly escorted for the entirety of her travel while on board and in the airports."" They also let me know they were logging this into their 'sophisticated database"" so leaders can review it. I addition, to make the reservation one has to call AA. The AA rep on the 1-800 stated they would waive the fee. However, when I checked her in the AA rep at the airport stated there would be an additional charge. I explained that the 1-800 folks waived the fee; the airport agent charged me regardless and even pulled out the AA policies to show me. There was definitely a communications/knowledge gap in process. I should have been told upfront or a note placed on the file that it was waived. Had I known I would have had to pay the fee, I would not have booked the flight (the fee was 50% more than the one way flight)."
"   Nashville to Charleston via Atlanta. This was my second negative experience with Delta within 4 months on two separate business trips. Last time I experienced a 6 plus hour delay and they kept reassuring us ""it would only be a little while longer"" then they cancelled the flight altogether. No offers were made at all to make any passenger feel better about their service, just a rebooking. Today travel was going smoother, I had a two hour planned delay and I asked a Delta rep if they could put me on a near empty flight that had seating available and left an hour earlier. I didn't even have a checked bag. I was treated rudely by Delta staff and told it was a $50 up charge even though I had no baggage and I explained my previous poor experience. You would think they would want to help a little at no cost to them. The Delta staff didn't care and didn't even offer to attempt to ask anyone what could be done. I'm not a rude passenger, just hoping they would help me out to have a better experience this time. I own a small business and I think it's a shame when a company becomes so large that common sense and courtesy to customers cannot prevail. I would be appalled if my employee treated my customer this way. I will be interested to see if Delta cares enough to contact me, if not, there are other airlines I can use for my business travel for me, my employees and my family. It's disappointing because as a loyal customer for years, I remember when Delta actually cared about their customers' experiences."
"   Nashville to Lawton via Dallas Ft Worth. My initial flight was going to be over three hours late on departure due to a mechanical problem with the aircraft. I was able to book another flight out of Nashville. However on this flight, I was forced to check my carry-on bag because the overhead storage areas were full. After boarding this aircraft I noticed many items in the overhead storage that the flight crew should have required to be placed under the seats; things like shopping bags and purses. When I arrived at DFW for my connection I noted an earlier flight to my final destination that would save me 3 hours stuck in the airport. I proceeded to that gate and attempted to go standby. I was told that I was not eligible for that flight because I must travel with my checked bag. That's right, the bag I was forced to check against my will. This could have been prevented if the flight crew monitored what was being placed in the overhead storage. I rarely fly AA on purpose. And when I do, without fail, I am reminded why I avoid them."
"   Nashville to San Francisco via Salt Lake City. Where to start, we got to Nashville airport with 2 check in bags each (3 of us traveling) and thought it would be easier to check in at the road side counter. The guy there weighed all our bags and then said 'come around this side of the counter and see the total cost for your bags', it was a total of $480 USD for the 6 bags. Now mind you we weighed all our bags before getting to the airport, they were on the limit yes, but he tried to say 1 was close to 60 pound. He then said he would make them all go through for the usual $30 per bag if we 'look after him', so we had to pay him cash (he had a massive amount of cash in his pocket) not so sure if this is Deltas policy. Onboard our leg from SLC to San Fran we asked for a beverage in which we were charged for. We were in Comfort + seating which clearly states on their website and in their brochure in the back of the seat that all drinks including alcohol are free. When asking if this is the case we got a little chuckle and 'argh no mam, no they're not included' and he proceeded to charge us. After re reading the brochure I asked the other attendant who looked at me blankly and said 'yes that's right they're included'. I advised him that his colleague doesn't know this and he has been charging all of us for what's supposed to be included. He had to go and refund everyone one by one. Then to top it off we get to San Francisco airport, get our luggage and my sister in laws brand new Jeep suitcase is distroyed. Literally falling apart. Looks like it had been run over. So off we go to luggage counter and the lady there - while chewing on a lollie - looks at us like we're morons and says 'oh I can get you another one but it won't be a Jeep one sorry'. Well that will have to do unless you want us to carry our underwear and toiletries from San Francisco back to Melbourne. Appalling Delta, very disappointed all round!"
   Nassau to Pittsburgh via Miami. I was traveling  with my 2.5 year old daughter and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. This was only her 2nd flight and I truly appreciate everything both flight attendants did to make our flights so enjoyable! Thank you again.
"   Never will we fly with Delta Air Lines again. We travelled from Heathrow to Atlanta on 28/12/2016 and our flight was delayed by two hours which meant that we missed our connecting flight to the Dominican Republic. We were reassured at Heathrow that rebooking would be taken care of. There was no further information at any point other than vague and empty reassurances after which we had to wait in a queue for immigration control for one and half hours. By this time I had a migraine and felt very unwell from the stress of the entire situation. After another queue at re-booking queue of 30 minutes were we told that there were no further flights for the day and we were booked into the Holiday Inn South Hotel, and provided with food vouchers for an evening meal and breakfast. We lost a day of our holiday as a result. On our return journey 10/01/17, our flight was delayed again and we were not sure if we had missed the connecting flight to London Heathrow as again we were not given any information. We were very anxious about missing the flight again, and we left our camera on the aircraft. We were in a queue for immigration for two hours - no information was forthcoming despite repeated requests for information as it was likely we could be re-booked for the 09.37 flight later that evening. We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States. We then arrived at re-booking and had to wait a further 30 minutes to be told that we had been booked on the next flight which was leaving in 5 minutes and that we should run to the boarding gates. We pushed our way through the security ran all the way to the shuttle train, down corridors and up escalators and got to the gate to be told the flight had gone and there was nothing they could do. We were given a voucher to stay at the Ramada Plaza hotel. We did not have any hand luggage as this was checked on the flight but we were told we could collect an overnight pack. The queue for this appeared a further 30 minute wait so we headed off to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to queue for a further 30 minutes before being allocated a room for the night. We were told that food vouchers could not be provided as this should have been given by the staff at the airport. We order some food which arrived at 1.00 am in the morning which we paid for using our visa card. As a result of the delays my husband has had to take a day's leave due to the delays."
"   New Bern to Key West via Atlanta. This flight was supposed to leave at 0550 this am, it was delayed until 0800, then delayed until 1030, now delayed until 1058. We will miss our stand by flight from Atlanta to Key West, and have have to wait until 3.02pm and arrive in Key West at 5pm. Looking at a wasted day of our vacation. We are paying top dollar to stay in Key West and had purchased tickets for a festival today that ends at 5pm ($85). We won't get there to even enjoy a part of the beautiful weather. I have been up since 0130am. No food court, no bottled water offered, just doughnut and coffee. All Delta has offered is $125 voucher for a $377 flight. I find it very hard to understand why there are not any locally based standby pilots in case of sickness, and now no fuel. Very disappointing Delta - I expected better customer relations from you."
"   New Orleans to Dallas Ft Worth, I have been an American Airlines Advantage member for several years. I used 60000 rewards miles to book flight 1300 from New Orleans to Dallas. In addition to 60,000 miles, I was charged $75.00 for booking too close to the date of travel, and $11.20 in tax. I live far from the airport. It takes at least 1.5 hours to travel each way between my home and MSY. I arrived at 3:15 pm for the scheduled departure of flight 1300 at 5:25pm. Not long before 5:25 pm, passengers were advised the flight was delayed until 8:00 pm. At 8pm the flight was cancelled. At this time I had been travelling 8 hours including waiting in the airport. The gate personnel advised the flight would be rescheduled to 7/11. I was travelling to a memorial service scheduled for 7/11. I was unable to make the memorial service. I was offered a hotel room and a meal voucher, but not offer a seat on another airline. I doubt I will ever again fly with American. For years American was my choice for air travel. Not now. It appears they little or no respect for their customers."
   New Orleans to Philadelphia. I fly American Airlines as much as possible due to convenience. I recently purchased a ticket the night before for $500 and the next day the ticket was $57. This was a family emergency but they refused to refund or help with this ridiculous cost. It suppose to be $200 to change your flight. Not sticking to their own policy apparently.  I'll be avoiding them at all costs moving forward.
"   New Orleans to Philadelphia. Let me first say that American has long been my carrier of choice which is evident via my over 300,000 miles logged in the past 5 years (splitting time with Delta and SouthWest too). However, recent changes will be the driving factor for my migration to a new primary carrier. I don't mind the ability to buy premium seating but it has now grown out of control. American now intentionally forces me in a seat that is not my preference just so they can sucker me into paying for my desired position.  The additional requirements preventing carry on baggage for economy coach, again could be bearable but only if the carrier holds itself to a higher turnaround time (which it does not). I continue to experience delays and issues each time I fly American. Today it was a flight crew delay for 2+ hours followed by an equipment delay of 20 additional minutes. I'm done."
"   New Orleans to San Jose with Delta. Very disappointed and frustrated with Delta. This was the first time I have had such a bad experience flying. I was supposed to arrive home by Monday evening, but the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to mechanical failure so I would be missing my connection. I was rerouted to go home via a different airport, but that flight was also delayed by 2 hours due to weather.  After standing in line for 45 minutes and spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was rescheduled for a flight out the following morning. Delta at least covered the accommodation, but I had to contact my work last minute. I thought the saga had ended when I arrived back at the airport the next morning. I was in for a surprise. I called the central help line to see if I could get my bag checked for free, since I had purchased liquid souvenirs after passing security the day before. The agent on the phone said they would maybe reimburse me, but thankfully noticed that my flight out that morning was delayed by 2 hours. She made a very deft, last minute move to rebook me for an earlier flight out through a different city and I had to run through security to make that flight. Having reached my layover city en route home a day later than expected, I thought, ""I'm finally on my way."" However, Delta had the wrong flight information posted at the gates. I was not aware of the mixup until my name was called over the intercom for the final boarding call. I rushed to the correct gate and barely made it onto the aircraft on time. I was very very upset at this point. I had to conclude that since I had never experienced this type of delay-after-delay-after-mistakes before flying with other airlines, that it must be something to do with Delta. I would not fly Delta ever again. I am now home, 15 hours later than my original itinerary and exhausted from all the stress, uncertainty, and frustration."
"   New York JFK to Amsterdam. At the check-in, I was not assigned a seat and I was not given a boarding pass for my second flight with the same airline! I was told that that the seat will be assigned at the gate. Now I'm at the gate and I was told to wait twenty minutes to be assigned a seat and maybe the second boarding pass can be printed then. This is ridiculous!  Also the ground personnel is passive aggressive. Guys, this whole thing is pretty bad."
"   New York JFK to Boston. I hadn't flown on an American carrier for over 20 years. My experiences from back then were not among the best to be honest. I even considered to take the train instead. Therefore I had mixed feelings concerning my connecting flight from JFK to Boston during Easter Holiday. I shouldn't have worried at all. The gate was close to the Admiral's Lounge at Terminal 8 and I was able to spot the aircraft while being seated in the so called ""bureau""-section. Boarding started well ahead of the actual departure time and there seemed to be a very light load on this short hop to Boston. I only noticed upon boarding that this aircraft had a three-cabin-configuration and is usually used for transcontinental flights. As a frequent flyer I was assigned a seat in the C-class section. I was able to stretch out and use the interactive map. Doors were closed 15 minutes before departure and there were no delays on the tarmac and runway either. The friendly crew even managed to serve all passengers a softdrink and a cookie. Take notice: This was a 42-minutes-flight only. Arrival into Boston was 20 minutes before schedule and bags were out on the belt 10 minutes later. I will not hesitate to use American Airlines again in the future."
"   New York JFK to Dublin return with Delta, and travel to and back the seats were changed, but still were able to not only stay in Premium Economy, but in the two seat arrangement. DUB to JFK was in bulkhead seats with great leg room, but the meal tray was an issue, should one be lets say on the heavier side; I had set up the seats a few months ago. Customer service on the phone upgrading to Premium Economy was easy. Flight was good, stewardesses were great, extra leg room and seat comfort with the pillow they supply was decent, movie selection was good, watched two going over, three coming back. I have a gluten intolerance and received my food a bit earlier and it was actually pretty decent. The priority check-in, especially at JFK with the shorter TSA line was really nice, the bottled water at check in was just a plus. Flying again in a few months in Premium Economy and looking forward to it, especially since the flight will be an A330."
"   New York JFK to Frankfurt with Delta. Awesome service, flight attendants are helpful, polite and efficient. Flight entertainment is nice and the food was tasty. Flat bed seat was very comfy. Flying Delta airlines is always a nice experience. Ground crew is nice and willing to help. Lounge is nice and clean, with nice food selection."
"   New York JFK to Ft Lauderdale. I've purchased an online ticket and when I get to the airport I was assigned my seat in boarding pass. At the gate i was informed by the agent the flight is overbooked and if I do decide to go on a later flight I will be awarded with an $800 voucher since it was not to late and sounds great so I said yes I'm in, then she took my boarding pass she copied and told me to go ahead and have a she'll call. I was very hungry but I waited till everyone board which was over an hr of course, later she called my name then she gave me a new boarding pass she said go in, like I had no choice. So I get on the plane, after takeoff I grabbed my book and found my original boarding pass with a seat that the attendant just gave a free earpiece to, and I was just charged for one. I realized she had given my seat away to someone else and give me a broken seat. When I point it out to the flight attendant she said there's nothing they can do for me that the flight is full (with empty first class seats of course) however she will send a red code to the counter at the exit, and go talk to an agent when landed which I did - at the counter in FLL she completely ignored me. She had told me to call if I have a complaint she's busy. "
"   New York JFK to Heathrow. Hadn't flown AA for more than 4 years and took this return instead of BA for better flight timing. What an awful and disappointing business class experience. Lounge at JFK was overcrowded, food abysmal and staff the rudest I have encountered. Hoping that things would improve on the flight, how wrong I was! Seats were worn and quite dirty, service was abrupt and lacking anything of note. Food is served in large portions, but was very bland and the service was so slow. IFE is okay and didn't watch much anyway. BA has gotten a lot worse in recent times, but even they exceed these terrible American Airlines standards."
"   New York JFK to Los Angeles. I was an American Airlines Advantage member for few years, and this is the first, and probably the last time I use them! Absolutely terrible from every possible angle. To begin with before I signed up for AA program it was many benefits included but not limited to Priority boarding. Which was pretty good, since I used it with different airlines. Now things changes and you get regular boarding, they just put you ahead in group number 5, but customer service at the gate of JFK was so terrible that you literally have to fight to get on board with your group since all people lined up and in rush. Another thing they forcing people to check carry on. Old planes. On the way back from Vegas even worse. Same thing customer service at the gate is so terrible, had 2 small carry on bags and wallet over my shoulder she screamed at me that I had 3 bags. Stopped me and was very impolite saying that I had to put my wallet inside my bag."
"   New York JFK to Manchester. American Airlines is probably the worst airline I've ever flown with. After boarding we were kept waiting on the group for around 1h50 mins with very little explanation of why. I was sat at the rear of the aircraft and as there is no closed off area for staff they were pretty much just sat around chatting loudly (which is fine, but on most aircraft they have a closed off area and can do it without everyone having to listen). This aircraft had no seat back TVs so we had nothing to do. After take off we were given a very poor dinner, although there was a good selection of drinks. The experience so far was generally poor, but mildly acceptable considering it's a budget airline. However the last 2 hours of the flight were awful. Suddenly the smoke alarms began to sound and the staff very casually checked the aircraft for signs of danger (this was only looking in bathrooms and touching walls for signs of heat) for about 10 minutes. The alarms sounded for the remainder of the flight with no announcement or instructions to reassure passengers. Awful, avoid American Airlines."
"   New York JFK to Phoenix. My name was misspelled instead of an N had a M, there was not one person capable of fixing the misspelled. I was send to 4 different kiosk, two hours later I was let in with the misspelled name. Now while 9 members of my family are flying to my son's graduation I will be sitting at the airport for 8 hours hoping I could it be there with him. Never in my life will fly American."
"   New York JFK to Portland, Oregon with Delta Air Lines. First, my ticket said terminal 4, even though the departing terminal was terminal 2. Check-in was fine. Boarding Counter people were excellent. Plane was very clean, IFE was responsive. Flight Attendants were kind and helpful, and I especially love their new uniforms. Seat was nice, declined to 160 degrees, and was very cushioned. Steak and mashed potatoes with garlicky greens were better than delicious. For dessert, I had Italian ice in a plastic cup. All in all, very comfortable, very good flight. I recommend Delta Airlines."
"   New York JFK to San Diego. I cannot even explain what a terrible experience I had on American Airlines. The service was poor,  cleanliness was terrible, the food options were bad,  etc. I flew on Alaska on my way to New York and it was great! Such kind, helpful service. Everything about that experience was quite the opposite of my experience on American. To end what was already a bad flight, I received my luggage to discover that my $300 coat had been stolen out of it. American did nothing to help the situation. "
"   New York JFK to San Diego. New aircraft with mood lightning and new style of seat, big tv screens and Bose headphones. Only negative was the headrest, which was not well padded. Large movie selection. Excellent preordered food, but very restricted wine selection. Liked especially the ice-cream Sundae. Pilot had been sucked in a huge traffic jam, so arrived about 40 minutes after the plane should have taken off. Additionally evening air traffic delay at JFK, so that the plane departed about 2 hours late. Made up some of this delay, but we arrived nevertheless 40 minutes late. Very strange baggage delivery in San Diego, belt changed three times before they started delivery. in summary a quite good flight and service."
"   New York JFK to San Diego. This is the second time I travel to San Diego with American Airlines and I haven't had the best experience. Both times the plane was delayed or the people took too long to open the bridge. Last night, we departed late and got to San Diego later than expected time. I would like more for my money because this flight wasn't cheap. It didn't have a screen in back of every seat like Delta and JetBlue, they also didn't have options with snacks."
"   New York LaGuardia to Sarasota. I was waiting to board and looked out the window and saw a Delta baggage handler throw each bag from the baggage truck onto the bag escalator. He was an able bodied young man- why does he need to throw the bags?? It shows a great disrespect and carelessness, and is not representative of the Delta I know and like. Please fix this attitude."
"   New York to Atlanta. Nothing particulartly positive about this flight. The Delta First Class seat looks like a 1990s long-haul business class seat, with the difference it does not recline and there is no footrest. Food selection very limited (sandwich or chicken salad), I took the salad and quality was overall good; beverages selection limited as well and a Chardonnay served in a plastic glass before take.off is something simply meaningless (especially if during dinner proper glasses are used). Crew - like in the previous long-haul flight - seemed a bit too ""casual"", which can be easily misunderstood with unprofessional (I have been more than once addressed as ""honey"" during the flight). IFE very good on such a short flight, with large screen and possibility to use my own headphones. Overall an average experience."
"   New York to Buffalo return. On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta. I experienced a Europe-US flight with Delta last year on A KLM ticket which was a good one. I would definitely consider flying with Delta again if the ticket price is competitive."
"   New York to Chicago. Was not looking forward to taking this domestic flight in the US. The reviews seem to be universally poor. This flight was a bit of a non-event for me. The flight departed on time and the crew were polite and seemed happy to be there. The food was truly awful, and the plane was in bad condition, dirty and quite old. No IFE at all. First Class was on par with economy on a domestic Qantas flight. Took ages to get points and SC awarded and then only after queries. "
"   New York to Dallas. The first leg of a return from New York to Sydney via Dallas. The first headache on this trip is getting out of Midtown Manhattan to La Guardia. That was an hour to cover 9 miles. I try and avoid JFK as the run takes two hours. La Guardia is old but functional. Light loads means clearing TSA quickly and into the small but fine Admirals Lounge. New aircraft, great IFE and early arrivals meant hassle free travel. Sure you have to bring your own food but that's the way it is. AA has its critics and I am not one of them based on this and the recent trans US travel."
"   New York to Detroit. Second time flying with American Airlines. First time was our honeymoon in May of 2017. That trip we were delayed 7 times, missed our connection flight, and were provided a hotel room which we were not given any direction on how to get to once we got off the plane and picked up our luggage. The staff was very rude to my wife and I and would not help us. We did get upgraded seats which was nice but that did not change my opinion or experience with American Airlines. The second trip was also an awful experience (Roundtrip from Detroit to New York). On our way home, our flight was delayed once and then later cancelled. I called customer service and tried to see what I needed to do to get another flight. I was about to lose service and told the customer service employee I would call him back because we are about to be disconnected. Before I could call back, the employee booked my wife and I to fly to Charlotte and then to Detroit 8 hours later. I called again and addressed this issue and the employee that time was helpful and told me to wait until I get to the airport to book or change my flight. I arrived at the airport in NY and changed my flight to land in Chicago and catch a connecting flight there to Detroit. We were delayed for over an hour trying to leave NY. Once we landed in Chicago, again we were delayed. Once on the plane, we were delayed again. The staff on the plane was not helpful and also the terminal staff was extremely rude to us. The last flight from Chicago to Detroit, there was a flight attendant who was the first one to actually be kind and helpful to us. I will not choose this airline again."
"   New York to El Paso via Dallas Ft Worth. Canceled and delayed, not because of weather, because throughout a 2 day process they were not able to coordinate a pilot and crew together at the same time even though they sold us tickets to an on-time flight. This company should be ashamed of his negligence to their ability to function as a serious business."
"   New York to Keflavik. Flight DL446 was scheduled at 9PM July 13, ended up departing 11:13AM the next day. It was delayed hour after hour, first notification of delay was at around 6:30PM that it was delayed to 10:05PM, then 5 minutes later told it is delayed to 11:15PM, then 12:15AM, 1:02, 1:32, 1:50, 2:30 and finally 7AM (this delay was announced at 2:20AM). I decided to cancel and refund my ticket at 2:30AM and just leave as I was going to Reykjavik for the weekend and it would have been a waste. Thankfully the Delta hotline accepted the refund and told I was to receive my money in one week (we'll see how that goes) and that I had to go to baggage service desk in JFK to claim my bag. I filed a baggage request form and was told that it will be delivered to my house in Manhattan by 3:30PM and that the baggage employees arrive at 5:40AM (I had to wait 2.5hrs at least). I had already been at the airport for 8 hours so did not want to wait. Well, now I regret it. Bag never left the plane and boarded the flight to Reykjavik. Not sure how that happened. On July 14, hotline employee told me that it will board the next flight (DL246 KEF-JFK on July 15). I said no problem and did not mind the wait, and I handled this all calmly even though almost all my belongings are in that bag as I am in NY for a few weeks only. I call again today (July 15) and the bag is still in Reykjavik and employee is not sure when it will come back to NY. Honestly I do not mind waiting but to be promised to receive the bag on a day and then for it not to happen not once, but twice, is very poor customer service. After 8 hours in the airport and cancelling my trip, not having my bag with me is the last thing I would want to happen. Also, every single time I called them (at least 6 times so far), I waited at least 20 to 25 minutes on hold before someone picked up."
"   New York to Lisbon, returning Dublin to new York. The price, despite being in summer season, was excellent, especially in comparison to most other options. The level of service was the best we've experienced in many years of travel. It begins with the cockpit crew and attendants greeting passengers on entrance to and departure from the flights. They seemed more personable and enthusiastic than is common, and communicated pride and pleasure in their work. The food was surprisingly good and plentiful, free beverages were varied and frequent. We counted two passes with hot towels and four involving beverages. The entertainment options were fresh and divergent.Finally, we were forced to return due to a member of family's medical emergency. Delta could not have been more supportive and considerate related to this circumstance. Delta has announced in this past week, the upcoming utilization of a system involving in flight wifi free of charges will be initiated in the near future."
"   New York to Los Angeles. American Airlines managed to somehow cancel our tickets that were purchased months previously. The flight was critical for us as we were flying from New York to Los Angeles to connect for our international flight back to Australia later the same day. The first inkling of a potential problem was the day before when I was unable to check in online, so spent hours at an AA office in Manhattan trying to resolve the issue. I was given various explanations but ultimately they accepted no responsibility, asserting that our travel agent in Australia had cancelled or voided the tickets. Again, at the check in counter on the day of the flight, the issue remained unresolved with a supervisor basically saying that our travel agent had ripped us off. We had no alternative but to purchase new tickets (fortunately, I had made a tentative booking the day before in case it was needed, otherwise we would have likely missed our LAX connection considering all flights were full). After returning home, AA repeated their conclusion after investigating the matter that our travel agent had cancelled our tickets which of course they denied so demanded further investigation. Weeks later, American Airlines admitted that the error was theirs all along and offered to reimburse the cost of the new tickets. There was also a gesture of compensation for our inconvenience - a $50 voucher towards another flight on American Airlines - of zero value to us in Australia. Overall, a very disappointing experience given the stress and inconvenience that resulted from their mistake. I would suggest that their staff receive improved training on dealing with such hopefully rare cases - being left in the lurch at a critical time by indifferent staff doesn't leave you with a great impression of an airline."
"   New York to Miami. Lost not one but all 4 luggages. No one from Delta has assisted us during this stressful and utterly inconvenient episode. No one at Delta lost baggage department picks up the phone (we waited once over an hour on the line), chat line unable to help , email customer service does not respond, twitter account does not respond. We have no idea where our luggage is and are completely left on our own without information. Not even Ryanair is this bad and that is telling a lot about this airline."
"   New York to Orlando was the best short haul flight I've taken.  Cabin crew were friendly, casual but efficient. I was amazed by the retrofitted cabin design and how bright it was. Overhead bin was massive and a carry-on suitcase could fit sitting on the side of the suitcase instead of flat as they normally do. I appreciated when the crew kindly reminded every passenger to get to their seat as soon as possible and move away from the aisle to speed up the boarding process, since we started boarding a few minutes behind the scheduled boarding time but arrived in Orlando 20min early. The entertainment system was very amazing and it's even better than those on long haul international flights. Big screen and a lot of movies to choose from. Free non-alcoholic beverage and snack is a common practice in US domestics flights. I will choose Delta again."
"   New York to Sao Paulo return. This was my first time to fly with American Airlines. I found the cabin crew most unfriendly and totally disinterested in any passengers. Both flights were similar in duration ie. just under 10 hours. Cabin crew appeared to want to get the meal out of the way as soon as it was safe to serve. About one and a half hours into both overnight flights all meals were served and cleared. Cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 hours to resurface one and a half hours before landing to serve a snack. There was no cabin crew interaction with fare paying passengers for the majority of both flights. There was no provision of water to keep passengers hydrated for an exceptionally long flight. There were no young staff as part of the cabin crew. I have been told the more mature cabin crew are very obsessive over staffing the long haul routes. What a shame. Pity they lack customer service. Also, I was witness to a male cabin crew member telling a young mother holding a baby to sit down in a not so very nice tone of voice, until they were finished working. I almost felt like saying something as I felt he was very rude and condescending to this young mother. American airlines is far from customer orientated."
"   New York to Seattle. The flight was delayed due to a flight attendant being late from another flight. When many of us passengers who were taking connecting flights voiced our concerns about missing our flights to the flight attendants we were ensured that we would reach or something would be done. We arrived in Seattle at 1050 which was approx 30 minutes later than expecting. Due to my connecting flight being on the complete other side of the huge airport I missed my flight, along with many others. Then I was told that although I was supposed to be on a connecting flight I could still get my bags at SeaTac but of course my bags were already at my final destination. It was absolutely horrible!! I would never fly Delta again."
"   Norfolk to Dayton via Washington. I was flying with my 90 year old grandmother who has limited mobility. Our first flight was delayed about 30 minutes in Norfolk so it was a rush to catch our connecting flight. I was very worried we would miss our next flight with my grandmother being in a wheel chair. American Airlines was very helpful to accommodate us. They brought us our own handicap-accessible bus, took us right to our gate and wheeled us straight onto the next plane. We made it with time to spare! The pilot saw how exhausted my elderly grandma looked, and upgraded us to first class. He made our whole day! Thank you American Airlines!"
"   Norfolk to Philadelphia. A couple weeks ago I was disallowed to fly with American Airlines. My father and I had booked a trip to Thailand 3 months in advance and waited in the airport for hours as they tried to figure out what was wrong. As time flew by and they were trying to figure out we were there three hours early to check in and missed our flight due to them telling us my Father had fraudulent activity in his card. I can’t even explained how embarrassing it was. He called his card he used to pay for the trip right in front of them and the lady told them “ He doesn’t even have a balance, it’s paid off. There is no fraudulent activity on this card. They bounced the ball off the wall a little more then switched from my Father to me saying I had fraudulent activity on my card. Funny thing is my dad payed for the trip not me. I’ve never flown or attempted to fly with American Airlines in my life. They then said that I could fly but I would have to pay in cash for a ticket to Thailand that day which was $6000. We booked our flight and rooms for about $1000 each.  We were not refunded our money. I have tried to contact corporate office several times a day since the incident and still no response. .Before this I had heard a few negative things about American Airlines but not enough to deter me from flying with them. They ruined a huge trip and still haven’t given us a reason because I guarantee there isn’t one. "
"   Not the best long-haul experience. My seat was changed while boarding to a row far away from my travel companion, no explanation or apology was provided. Gate staff at PHL are extremely rude, bordering on hostile, and are in need of serious customer service retraining. I do not appreciate PHL gate staff barking orders at passengers and not using the PA system prior to a 9 and a half hour long-haul flight. Upon boarding, a passenger opened a box of very smelly food and proceeded to eat it during push back - flight attendants did nothing to intervene. The quantity of diner food items was very stingy for such a long flight, and I would have been starving if I did not bring my own food. Flight attendant servicing my row was also stingy with the complimentary wine - would not offer a refill until dinner service was completed. The trip back to the US was a completely different and very positive experience."
   Omaha to Chicago. Terrible! There were many empty seats. They will charge you for your every luggage 60$ each. You will also be asked to give up your seats if you seem weight heavier. A lot of customers were not satisfied during the flight.
"   On a previous trip from Columbus to Chicago, my flight was delayed twice and then rebooked for the next day. A trip the following month, my flight was delayed two hours, leaving passengers on the flight for an hour in their seats, first due to paperwork for maintenance that wasn't completed, then due to crew needing a break. I was hesitant to fly American again for my trip in November, but booked anyways giving it another chance. Arriving to the airport and waiting at my gate, the time came for boarding and my flight wasn't on the screen. I checked and the gate had been switched. I went to the new gate and they told me my gate was changed again. I went to the new gate again and they said that my flight was at the old gate, but that it had been delayed by an hour and a half without any reason. Now, arriving to the airport for my return flight, knowing it was going to be delayed, I found out it was in fact delayed again by an hour. I refuse to fly American Airlines again."
"   On time departure from Vancouver, attentive cabin attendants, good breakfast served. Comfortable seats, good selection of movies, etc. On time arrival into DFW. After a 5 hour layover, boarded next 7pm flight at 6.15pm. Left the gate at at 6.50 and then sat on the ground for three hours with only one announcement from the cockpit to the effect that there was a ""problem"" which was being addressed, Eventually announcement that we were going back to the gate. After 40 minutes at the gate, problem apparently solved and we took off. Fifteen minutes into the flight captain informs that we are returning to DFW as problem still not resolved. Landing complete with fire brigades and ambulances waiting on the side of the runway. On arrival at the gate we are informed flight is now cancelled and we need to disembark. Back at the gate counter, vouchers for hotel and meals are handed out. Assigned hotel, Hyatt, within a 5 minute walk from the gate. Next day the now 10am flight closed the door at 10.30 was already wondering whether we were ever going to leave Dallas after all. Once in the air, service was good, drinks and lunch served followed by ""breakfast"" at 9pm one hour before landing. Cabin crew very attentive."
"   On Tuesday, April 4th 2017, I flew back home with American Airlines to Dallas Fort Worth Airport. My flight was scheduled to depart at 5.50 pm. At around 5.30, when it was time to board, they announced that the flight would be delayed because the First Officer was in Washington D.C. and his flight had not yet departed for LGA. Flight was delayed a half hour, later they came back saying that the plane had still not departed and it probably wouldn't be until much later. At around 7.00 pm, the pilot announced that the First Officer's flight had barely taken off and hopefully we could depart by 8 pm. We finally began boarding at around 7.30 pm and did not depart until almost 8.30 pm. I was supposed to land in DFW at 8.45 pm and did not land until past 11.00 pm. I reached out to AA hoping they could somehow fix this situation since it was not mechanical, operational or due to weather and the most I got was an apology. Unfortunately AA has been declining in punctuality and Customer service. It is no as longer reliable as it used to be. Very disappointing."
"   One of the best flights I have been on! Two of the flight attendants spent time letting every passenger know their connecting gate in Detroit and how to navigate the Airport. This was amazing and appreciated by everyone. All attendants should be giving passengers this kind of service and she did it with a smile!  Will continue to use Delta and hope the airlines train all employees to be like this! Great flight, #2807 4:59 from Laguardia to Detroit."
"   Originally supposed to fly Boston to Vienna via Amsterdam. I arrived at terminal A at the airport in Boston at 13.00 for the 16.45 flight. Check-in took longer than it should. I then went to the Delta skyclub lounge and it was dirty. The food was mediocre. You also have to ask an employee for the wifi password. I went to the gate and the flight started boarding at the normal time. Seats were not the most comfortable, even for business class. A crew member rudely forced me to put my passport in the overhead bin rather than in front of me. I never forget stuff on aircrafts! We were just about to depart when the captain told us there was a delay because of a broken air vent in the cockpit that was just discovered. The plane was sitting at that gate all day. Why didn’t they spot the damage when the plane arrived from Amsterdam that morning? First the crew spent 25 minutes trying to fix the vent in the hot sun with no air conditioning allowed, then another 30 minutes talking on the phone with their maintenance HQ, then they told us there would be a delay until 20.30 at night. We were forced to exit the aircraft so they could take it to the hangar. Now we had 300 people with missed connections waiting in line at the help desk with only 2 employees there. The staff acted uncaring and oblivious and many people were getting very angry with them. When I reached the front of the line the Delta customer service staff told me I couldn’t do anything and I was forced to stay on this delayed flight. They didn’t even look at other options! I did not see them look down at their computer screens when I asked them about re-booking. They probably just want my money. They never updated us on the repair progress but the flight was now delayed until 23.00. At that point I wouldn’t make it back to Austria for another 2 days. I called my travel agent and they successfully rebooked me on a 22.15 Lufthansa flight through Frankfurt. It was on time and everything about that airline (lounge and aircraft) was so much better than Delta! I arrived in Vienna 5 hours later than expected. I later found out the Delta flight to Amsterdam was eventually cancelled. Avoid this airline for international connections!"
"   Orlando to Detroit. I never write reviews, but this time I am. I had the best experience with Delta airlines last Saturday. I was flying with my two young children, who are both afraid to fly like their mother.  The seats on Delta were  very comfortable, roomy, actually had leg room. Plane also came with your own personal tablet/tv with a great variety of videos and movies to watch. The pilot continuously kept us informed, as occasionally there was some turbulence. The stewards very humorous and friendly. My son said after, ""mom I like flying"". I was very impressed from the time I drop my luggage off all the way to picking it up. Delta was a little more expensive then the other flights, but worth it.  Thank you, as you have no idea what anxieties we had after our last flight with a different company."
"   Orlando to Montego Bay via Charlotte. Terrible experience with American Airlines. We were very excited to go to our vacation this morning, But all these flight delays make us upset. Our flight to Miami was delayed for 1hour then we wait for hour and half more and eventually it was just canceled. It was looking nobody care about people in American Airlines. Information desk was closed when hundred people needed solutions to rebook flight. We eventually were rerouted to Jamaica by way of Charlotte, and experienced more delays at the gate for that flight! After finally boarding, then they made us sit on the plane for an hour and then one more, we were trapped in airplane! We should be on the beautiful Jamaica Resort at 2pm but it's looking we will be lucky to finally arrive at our destination by midnight."
"   Orlando to New York JFK. Flying American Airlines is the last option for me, it has to be based in price. This trip reinforced my image of the airline. Staff poor attitude, service is lacking, no food service. It is not a pleasant travel experience, it is more like traveling by bus."
"   Orlando to San Francisco. I booked my flight through a 3rd party (justfly.com), and I selected my flight as Direct. When I go to the airport and do the whole process to go to the gate I found out that I had to do a stop over in Charlotte. I took the flight because I was an emergency, but I decided to called the next day. When I called to ask, why the have discrepancies in their website, no body was available to help me. I decided to call AA customer service to claim because even my confirmation letter says that I had to do a stop and also change planes. My intention at this point is not to ask for a refund or nothing, just to let them know the discrepancies in a website. As a customer the minimum I deserve is that my questions can be answered with courtesy and respect. "
"   Our family of four flew from Toronto to Philadelphia via Detroit in Nov 2016, and back again on the same segments. I believe it is the first time we've flown Delta, and we were impressed despite a few hiccups: In general the staff were professional and personable, there seemed to be a real priority on leaving/arriving on time, ground services were able to move passengers onto the plane in good time despite the challenges. Appreciated the free onboard movies and being able to download the gogo app real-time to play the movie, did not use Wi-Fi for Internet access. We got a super deal for this fare. Toronto to Detroit a smaller plane - we were all seated apart from each other, which was not optimal but we knew check-in seat assignment was a condition of the fare we purchased (just didn't realize it could be at the gate) - apparently our names were called at the gate but we did not hear the announcement, and by the time we got to the desk, these were the best seats we could get - one of my children is 10 years old, so I think the system should aim to seat a parent with a child that age or younger - seat assignments at the gate are a bit frustrating, you're in 1 line with a mix of customer issues which take a little to a lot of time to resolve - I stood in line for about 15 minutes only to be told that I would have to wait until my name was called - I was seated in a window seat, in row of two seats. When an obese passenger sat down beside me, I felt very squished (the passenger took ~ 1.5 seats) and I knew (being somewhat claustrophobic) that flying for an hour would not be a tolerable situation - I requested and was granted a seat change to a spare seat so that issue was resolved. However, I think Delta should have given this passenger two seats, it was unfair for both of us, and I'm not sure how the issue would have been resolved had there not been a spare empty seat. - flight was smooth and on time - we were very impressed Detroit to Philly - larger plane, we were able to check-in online and get these seat assignments then, we were all seated together, flight was on time - the landing was a bit hard.  Return from Philly to Detroit we were unable to check-in online for some reason, and the error message said we should speak with a Special Services agent at the airport for check-in. It was strange, unlike the online check-in process Toronto-Philly, where I was able to check all four of us in, this time the system separated the two adults, and each child into a separate party - ie. we received three email notifications to check-in separately (which didn't work and we could not check-in online) - we had to speak with a Special Services agent, who was able to seat two of us together (adjacent aisle seats) and the other two in separate areas of the plane. Flight was smooth and on time, they were overbooked (probably due to the previous flight issue) but this issue was resolved. Detroit to Toronto there wasn't enough room to accommodate everyone at the gate area (I believe a previous flight had been cancelled) -the gate was small, seemed more like a hallway. The agent in Philly was able to seat 3 of us, we had to get 1 seat assigned at the gate - flight was delayed because there was a problem closing the cargo door - other than that the flight was smooth, great landing."
"   Our flight to Philadelphia was cancelled. We did not receive a text or email. We found out when we landed in Portland and checked the screen to find out the gate for our flight to Philadelphia. We spent hours in Portland and had to take a flight to Dallas and then Philadelphia. When we reached Dallas we were told there were earlier flights to Philadelphia we could been on but our luggage was already on the later flight. It took an additional 9 hours to get home, sitting in airports. We were not given any voucher for food or anything else.  Then they lost some of our luggage which was delivered to us at 2:45 AM. After 36 hours of no sleep, I was awakened by a call at 2:30AM that my luggage was being delivered. The personnel are rude, not helpful at all."
"   Our plane was delayed 30min from SFO. We got to PHX at 7.20. The flight was completely full. We asked the flight attendant to assist us to deplane as we needed to catch a connecting flight to Austin at 7.43. She said we have plenty of time and she can't do anything to help us. We ran to our gate which was all the way on the other end of the terminal. PHX airport is massive and it took us 20+ minute sprinting to our gate. If anyone who knows PHX airport, we went from gate A23 to gate B26. Got the our gate at 7.40 but the plane had closed it doors. Apparently the gate agent let the gate closed without us. They didn't even call or announce our name. So we end up paying for our hotel and got a standby ticket for the following day. Never again. This will be my last trip with this airline. The last time we flew with Southwest, they opened the door for their passenger who was late."
"   Over Christmas time I had flown 5 sectors on Delta. La Guardia to Winnipeg via Minneapolis, returning to San Francisco via Minneapolis, and then San Francisco to New York JFK. 4 out of 5 flights were on time, with even earlier arrival, one flight as delayed by 40 min, but we were advised by the delay. Excellent service at check-in, gate and on board. Cabin crew were attentive and drinks and snacks were served several time during flights. Good entertainment system onboard the longer flights from MSP to SFO and from SFO to JFK. Bags were delivered on the baggage belt in good amount of time. Will certainly fly with Delta again and recommend that other will do that as well."
"   Overall I would say American Airlines is a pretty good airline. My outbound flight from London Heathrow to Charlotte was fine, as was the internal between Charlotte and LaGuardia. But as my return flight from New York to London Heathrow was overnight I went ahead and purchased extra legroom which included priority boarding. Except it didn't. Boarding was exactly the same and the extra legroom was minimal. I am 6 foot 3 inches tall and even with the extra space it was pretty close to my knees. ""Up to an extra 6 inches"" it said, well I suppose it is correct as I estimate 3 inches was what I got and technically that is up to 6 inches. Called customer services who refused to even entertain my complain. Shocking customer service.
"
"   Palm Springs to Boston via Phoenix with American Airlines and American Eagle. This airline assumes no responsibility for the services that it sells to their customers. Three of us left Palm Springs (flight AA3076) on a beautiful day with hopes of connecting to our flight in Phoenix that was to bring us back to Boston (flight AA2341). Upon arrival to Phoenix our flight was running late, the flight attendant was aware of 2 groups of people with tight connections and all they did was to tell the plane to let those with tight connections to get off 1st and both groups were in the back of the airplane. We know how that worked out, we all got off last. They did not call the tower to say we were running late as reported to me by the person at the gate for Boston. There was only 30 minutes between reported landing time in Phoenix and lift off time to Boston if the 1st flight arrived on time. The gates were over 1/2 mile apart. I was the youngest in our group of three turning 65 this year and the oldest was 82. This information is all known by the airline upon booking a ticket on line. I ran to the gate for flight AA2341 and was told the doors were closed and are always closed 15 minutes before take off. I asked if she could call to see if the doors could be opened and she refused. The plane did not disconnect from gate for at least 6 more minutes. How is an 82 year old man suppose to walk 1/2 + miles to a connecting flight when seated in the back of the plane which takes 6-10 minutes to get out of allowing only 5-9 minutes of walking time (if it lands on time and it did not)? At the service desk rule 240 was not applied which entitles us to the first flight to Boston on any airline not just American which we were forced to do getting us home an entire day late. I emailed to customer relations who responded in a way that was unacceptable (basically saying sorry but there is nothing that can be done). I asked her to have a supervisor get back to me and not one response has been sent my way in over 2 weeks. The company needs some hospitality training."
"   Panama City to Appleton via Atlanta. Flying with a lap child was convenient. The staff was attentive and very sweet on all legs of our trip. It would have been helpful to have in flight entertainment included in the price of the ticket on the MD88 like on the A319 however. The A319 had headrest television with multiple options for children, the MD88 had no entertainment and a fee of 16 dollars to allow use of wifi. It was a short flight, however and our child was entertained with toys and l looking out the window. There was preboarding for us on all flights and no extra fee for her to fly."
"   Paris to Orlando via Dallas Ft Worth. Front staff members that tooks us from one side to the other without clear instructions to rearrange our delayed flight. It took us an couple of hours to resolve our issue. Rude and unpleasant flight attendants that were not helpful. My worst experience flying has been with American Airlines and I refuse to fly with them again! They keep promoting their credit card and I even thought about getting it but after this horrible experience, AA is a not go option."
"   Philadelphia to Dallas Ft Worth. On our trip, we were delayed due to weather. We were very pleased with how American Airlines' customer service took care of us. They re-routed us while we were on the delayed flight because they knew we wouldn't catch our next flight. They contacted us immediately to give us our new flights. When we arrived in Dallas, our bags did not make it. They contacted us the minute we exited the plane to let us know they would be delivered so we didn't have to wait in baggage claim. Their customer service was outstanding."
   Philadelphia to London with American Airlines. I fly first class international and working the US often. I travel for business and vacations with my family. Unfortunately I find the treatment of women routinely less kind and cordial than that of my male counterparts. It's absurd.
"   Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I have to say I don't think I will fly American ever again if I can help it. My experience today going back to Los Angeles was less than ideal. I was supposed to arrive back to L.A. on June 4th by 8pm PT because my flight was scheduled to leave 5:51pm ET. They delayed the flight 10 times before they canceled and changed the gate once which was just after midnight. So I waited seven hours just for them to keep delaying and to cancel. Guess what the reason was? The flight attendant was missing. They put me on another flight that was to leave out at 9:20 the next morning. That following morning we had a gate change and two delays but not by too many minutes. We did arrive on schedule to L.A. but guess what? My bag was kept on the original flight that was cancelled so my bag arrived to L.A before I did. I waited about an hour waiting on my bag at baggage claim thinking that they had it on the flight that I arrived on. I finally went to the back looking around to get answers as to why it was taking my bag so long. I looked at some bags they had positioned at the desk and guess what? One of those bags was mine. I could have saved an hour of time. They are horrible communicators. Very disappointed in my travel experience. The only good things that came out of this was that I arrived home safely, and they put me in a hotel for the night. Do better American Airlines."
"   Philadelphia to Phoenix, and I will never fly Delta again. I traveled with my wife and child. We were not able to sit together unless we paid more money. We got to the airport and got in line to check in. We waited 10 minutes and then were told we had to have boarding passes to be in that line. We finally got them and then we're told we had to pay $100 extra dollars because our bag was a pound over. The Delta employee was rude. We heard nothing but no no no. It was as if it was a luxury for us to pay hundreds of dollars to fly. Flying to and from we had a connecting flight. Each time we were sat in the last row and had to sprint to our next flight. We barely made our connecting flight home. Because we were in the last row and our connecting flight was in a terminal farthest away from us. Delta aren't family friendly."
"   Phoenix to Atlanta. Today American Airlines gave me the worst travel experience I've ever had. I bought a ""new"" economy tickets, unbeknownst to me. I've flown American Airlines 14 times in last couple of years and trust me American could careless. Their employees were rude and unprofessional. They charged me $50 For a bag fee at the gate even after the supervisor agreed the online check in was confusing. Save your money, fly Delta. AA is no deal with the exorbitant fees and they seem to dislike paying customers."
   Phoenix to Columbia via Atlanta. My experience with Delta has been horrible all around. I used miles which apparently they treat you like a 2nd class citizen which is insane because that means you fly often. I almost missed my first flight out on my connection due to them being late and having to wait for my carry on. They then made me feel bad about it. When I had booked my flight I had to pick an airport 2 hours from home because they were out of my nonblack out tickets. I tried to get my flight switched which they had flights for and they said yes and then changed their mind and said no. Now I go to check in and my flight is running late and I will most likely miss my connection. When I got frustrated they just told me it isn't their fault and I have no right to be upset. Then I asked it they can do anything and they said no it isn't our problem. I will now get home a day later. Terrible customer service. They should be embarrassed they treat their customers that fly with them often this way.
"   Phoenix to Minneapolis. Delta has started the policy of making you recheck in at the airport when they've had a ""plane switch."" This means that if you check in online, you'll likely get booted from your seat, even though you checked in before others who waited until they got to the airport, and technically made it easier for Delta. I got booted from a seat that I'd booked over a month in advance for both legs of a trip from Minneapolis to Phoenix, and both times they moved me to the back of the plane (from the front/middle like I'd booked). I have both the Delta app and Tripcase, and Delta has my phone number and email on file. Despite getting to the airport over 4 hours before my flight, I received no warning about this at all until the airplane started boarding, at which point they sprung this on me, with no recourse. Meanwhile, all the people who got to the airport after me were moved up."
"   Phoenix to Reno. The worst service ever! After checking in at the counter and handing my ID to the clerk, I was given someone else's ticket along with my sons ticket. I didn't notice till I was going through security. I was told I couldn't go through because my ID didn't match my ticket. I was in tears. I had waited 42 minutes in line and did not have time to go back to the ticket counter 2 floors down without missing my flight. I was escorted by some airport staff and they asked the counter person to make sure to call and let them know I was coming and hold my seat. I got there 15 min till departure time and was told my seats were given away to stand by and they were overbooked! I was in tears with my son. This was the last flight back home and all other flights from other airlines were sold out. They said there was nothing they could do for me even though it was their fault for giving me someone else's ticket and causing me to lose my seat. Customer service just gave me number to call. I have never experienced this kind of unprofessionalism. I would never recommend this airline to anyone."
"   Please don't fly with American Airlines. They will hold you on the runway for 31 minutes from an international flight, knowing what you have to do to get to your connecting flight. Then when you arrive at your terminal 9 minutes before your flight leaves they will not let you board cause the door is closed and they can't just reopen it. Yet the plane is still sitting at the terminal. Not to mention this is the last flight out of this terminal and the last one coming in. I know as I stayed there till 1am trying to get my problem solved with them. No one in customer services actually knows what that is at Dallas Fort Worth airport. Rude and care nothing about their customers. The best part is when we got to customer service they had three people working. When a line started up 2 of those 3 people just left. Leaving one person to deal with everything. Then when you ask to speak to a manager. They make you wait an hour until a flight attendant shows you were they are one gate over. As you stand there waiting to speak with them. They act like you are not even there. Typing away on the computer until you do something to really get the attention of them. Then they say well you can fly out tomorrow at 7.30 but we can do nothing else. So you call a 800 number and they tell you how they should pay for your hotel, food for the night/breakfast and get you to and from the airport/hotel and back. So I missed a 8.20pm flight and finally got to a hotel at 12.45am. Best part was we had 8 other people in the same boat. 2 from my flight and the rest were different flights. Come on AA horrible customer service and communication. Never will I waste my money with this airline."
"   Purchased an international flight through KLM, flying from New Orleans to Atlanta and then to Amsterdam. The first flight is so far 45 minutes late, and I'm worried about being able to catch my second flight. They are having technical difficulties with electricity, and it's totally inconvenient and frustrating."
   Quite a disappointing flight with American Airlines. I was on a long haul flight lasting 9 hours flying from Dallas to Amsterdam. Even though I have a small frame I found that the seating was cramped. There was not much leg room. The inflight entertainment was not working - no sound. There was no lighting (ie for reading) when the cabin lights were turned off at night. Screens were suspended from the top of the cabin rather than one screen per person at the back of each seat - no choice of what to watch.
"   Raleigh Durham to Cancun. I've traveled American Airlines for years, multiple trips with the same luggage. Today my carry on was suddenly too big by 1/2 inch so they made me check it. Needless to say, rude personnel was the start. Upon boarding, there was multiple bags larger than mine, very confusing. On board the employee rudeness continued. Everyone was very unfriendly and had poor attitudes. American Airlines has lost my business forever! To boot, flight is delayed and no one is prepared for the flight."
"   Raleigh Durham to Grand Junction via Dallas Ft Worth. Had a delayed flight out of Raleigh Durham into DFW which caused me to miss a connection. I understand it happens. American Airlines refused any extra service for the extended layover. I asked to use the Admirals club in DFW but was denied. Disappointed with lack of accommodation. Delays are routine, bad attitudes from gate agents are standard with American Airlines"
"   Raleigh Durham to La Guardia. Fell below par. The staff was nice, but our pilot was 2 hours late. A one and a half hour flight turned into 6 hours due to a pilot and the weather. Before returning home I got a alert that my flight was cancelled and that I needed to call Delta. There was a 3 hr wait time.  When I called again later, I waited another hour before finally speaking with someone. She stated there were no flights leaving LGA for the rest of the week, and I find that hard to believe. She stated the only flight leaving LGA was at 6 am the very next morning and  there was a possibility that the flight may not even take off due to weather conditions. I asked if I could have credit for a train or a bus at a later time. I understand that tickets are non refundable, but in the situation, I needed an alternative option. Thankfully we made it home safely even after all of the trouble and cutting our trip short."
"   Raleigh Durham to New York JFK. I been traveling with American Airlines for a long time now and never had a bad experience even with delays. However, Communication of the staff in this airline is terrible. The plane was delayed because of fog but it wasn’t communicated until arrival at a different airport. The inconvenience of this airline cause delayed for a special event I needed to attend. Even when finally arriving at JFK, they said we would arrive in 20 minutes, they been flying more than an hour in circles around the airport. I was very concerned and worry what was going on and no one can tell me why we haven’t landed yet. Recently, I try calling to change the time on my reservation departure time. They was very rude on the phone and can’t seem to help me or even give me a option. I will never travel with America Airlines again."
"   Recently flew 4 legs from Cleveland to Minneapolis, Minneapolis to Lincoln and return. Flight time was changed to 2 hours before original scheduled time. When we got to airport flight was delayed. Flight was overbooked, took some time to find volunteers to give up seats and then assign seat numbers to the rest of us. Got notification while in the air (we weren't able to receive it until we landed) that our 9.15 flight had been delayed until 2.30. Found out that it was because of a computer glitch that sent crew to other places and it would take that long to get them back. Changed to another flight but that flight was delayed for the same reason. Clerk said this is not the first time this has happened, you should have been here Saturday! Flight was then delayed until 4.30 and eventually cancelled."
"   Reno to Cancun via Salt Lake City. Totally floored how I simply can't get Delta to get me to my destination 2 days in a row. Supposed to had arrived yesterday but they closed the door on us yesterday. Today, after being delayed and missing two rescheduled connecting flight, we are still on the tarmac 3 hours later. Looks like we will never get to Cancun where we are to have medical treatment for my wife. When a 9 hour flight takes three days and totally takes you down, you wonder whether Delta has any business being in the air at all. I would give Delta Airlines a 0 but that is not an option."
"   Richmond to Johannesburg via Atlanta. I was very disappointed with Delta Airlines, I booked my ticket to Zimbabwe on January 28th, 2017 for a trip in May 2017. I purchased separately a Delta Comfort seat for an additional total of $418 because I knew the 16 hour non stop flight to and from ATL to JNB was long. This reservation was done over the phone since I needed the assistance of a Delta agent to book a ticket from JNB to HRE and from HRE to JNB. When it came to checking in 24 hours prior to my trip on the 1st of May, the online system would not let me check in online. I had to call a Delta agent to assist with checking in. After being on the phone for over an hour, the agent had to redo my reservation under a new record locator and confirmation number. According to this agent, the reason why it would not let me check in was because there was a Date of Birth mismatch. The agent assured me that my seating remained intact, and just the confirmation had changed. I was finally able to check in. When boarding at RIC airport, all of a sudden, the agent gave me a new seat number which was NOT the original seat number I reserved. When I arrived in ATL, my boarding pass wouldn't scan. I was supposed to board with the SKY priority zone, but could not. I was supposed to be on seat 31F which was a delta comfort seat. The agent told me that they were checking to see if my luggage had transferred to the flight. I thought that was an odd response. All of a sudden, I have a new boarding pass with a new seat number 53E and they just reassigned me with no notice or explanation. I located the seat thinking it was another Delta Comfort seat, but it my dismay, it was a basic economy class seat. I reported this mix up immediately to one of the stewardess. She got the agent that reassigned my seat. This agent claimed they did not have a record of my purchasing economy comfort seat, yet it was on the documentation that I presented to him. I insisted that I wanted my original seat back, but of course he was totally unwilling to help or do anything to look into it.He totally disregarded me and ignored everything i had to say and walked away. Now, I was told to take the economy seat as there were not delta comfort seats available as the plane was getting ready to takeoff. I had no choice but to do so. As a delta skymiles member, I was lied to by these agents and was very disrespected. If Skymiles members are treated this way and based on this experice, I will certainly cancelling my skymiles membership and delta gold credit card after being treated like trash. I also will not be recommending delta as customer service oriented airline. In my opinion, Delta demonstrated bad business practice, by relinquishing my comfort seat when it was already paid for. How do you loose a comfort seat which should have been secured for by payment?"
   Richmond to Kansas City. I feel I was forced to purchase premium seats ($185) because there was no available regular seats available to choose from to guarantee me a seat.  I would have chosen any regular seat to try to keep my cost as low as possible. When I contacted the airline they informed me that I would have been assigned one of those premium seats for free if I would not have already paid for it.  I'm sorry but I do not want to take a chance of getting bumped from a flight because I did not have an assigned seat.
"   Roundtrip with Delta from Frankfurt to Las Vegas via Detroit and San Francisco to Frankfurt via Atlanta. Overall a good experience. All flights on time or even ahead of schedule. Transfers at Detroit and Atlanta were easy and smooth. Delta has well organised hubs with plenty of ""Need Help"" centers. Staff is fantastic from check-in to flight attendants, always friendly, attentive and willing to help. Long-haul flights were on an older B767-400, but cabin was modern and well maintained. IFE was good with a wide selection of movies, but only 4 (FRA-DTW) and 2 (ATL-FRA) in German language. Meals were tasty and beverage service very generous on intercontinental flights. Beer, wine and spirits were free, served in the biggest plastic cups I ever got in economy class! Also water cups or bottles were offered by cabin crew every 45-60 minutes. US flights were a bit different. Planes (B737-900) were new, with IFE at every seat. Some movies were free, some you had to pay for (6$). There were a lot of movies available in German language (20-25), more than on flights to Germany. Free drinks and snacks (pretzels, cookies, peanuts) were offered several times, but you have to pay for alcoholic beverages and ""real"" food. Food offers were expensive and selection was rather poor. There is a lack of fresh food (e.g. salad) or hot meals, most offers included industrial food like crackers and crisps. That was the only negative aspect of my journey, in total Delta offers a good product."
"   Sacramento to Charlotte. Terrible customer service. Don't fly Group 9 they treat you like lower class. Don't let you have another bag. They also trick you with their insurance, it's a waste of money. Just poor all around not flying again. I have had two workers from different flights tell me my ticket is worth nothing. I was billed for it and that's money I earn so don't tell me it's not worth anything when I paid money. Sorry I can't drop some dollars on first class doesn't mean you treat people less. Fly any other airline, any other one is better than American"
"   Sacramento to Colorado Springs via Dallas Ft Worth. Not only was I ignored by the front counter lady, she was rude and continued to ask even how old I was after waiting 30 mins for her to notice I was there. When I tried asking a question she said “be patient.” This doesn’t even start with the fact when I arrived an hour early they told me I had to arrive two hours in order to check my bag so they moved me to the next flight when the first part of this review occurred in Dallas. I recommend unless they get some new employees never flying with this flight. They will for sure never have my business again. I would rather pay an extra 200 dollars than deal with the people boarding American Airlines."
"   Sacramento to Grand Rapids. American Airlines staff are very rude when asking about delays. I don't fly much so I get anxious when things change and they are not understanding. The flight attendants are great though. As far as the airline as a whole. I'm so fed up with all of the delays and problems they have. I'm getting back 2 hours late after an already late arrival from Sacramento to Grand Rapids. I asked if they could place me in a hotel for the night as I live far from Grand Rapids, so on top of arriving late I will have to drive for a while as well. They looked at me like I was crazy. Not to mention the money I've had to spend on food while waiting because I planned to be home. And they switched my terminal 3 times and by the time I got to my gate they switched it and to go all the way back to where I started. Definately not flying with them again - not impressed at all."
"   Sacramento to Phoenix. Awful service in general; if what you are looking for is to have a bad time, wasting more than 8 hours in a max 3 hours flight, being stressed and not enjoying the holidays because of the incompetence of the airline personnel in core tasks such as showing up on time and sending your luggage to the correct address, this company is the way to go. You would think of this as a bad coincidence, but when they did the same thing to almost every single customer in the flight, you realize that the company should not be operating in such conditions because they are not following their part of the service. Unless you want to have a reference point of what the worst service possible can be, don't even bother in checking the cost of a flight with this company."
   Sacramento to Scranton Wilkes-Barre. The nightmare started in Sacramento. We took a 1.5 hour delay for a door assist bottle being 500 psi to low for dispatch. I'm a licensed aircraft mechanic myself. So I can tell you with absolute certainty that this is part of a daily check by the flight attendants as well as maintenance. They waited until the airplane was fully boarded before someone noticed. This is avoidable if there maintenance department/flight attendants were doing there job. Since I took the delay on this flight it screwed up the rest of my trip. I missed the next connecting flight. Ended up waiting for hours until I was able to depart. Oh wait now I have an extra stop! I get to Philadelphia and this flight takes a 75 minute delay. I've had it with this airline and will be seeking an alternative route or airline in the future. Stay away from these people. They don't deserve to represent the country with that name.
"   Salt Lake City to Dallas Ft Worth. You would be better off walking to your destination. American Airlines is a complete joke and they prove this time and time again. Last night our flight was cancelled due to the crew needing to be ""off"" on time. They would not help us to get on any other flights last night. So we had to leave go home and come back today. Then to top it all off we get there today and they move our flight from 7:45 to 11 because the crew ""needs more rest"" - what about all of their customers who have been back and forth due to their lack of planning! Well on top of that they just moved us again to 12:45. No one will help us all they say is its out of their control. We have now been at the airport for a solid 24 hours, missed our grand daughters graduation, now spending my birthday at the airport. Not to mention we have a non refundable hotel and car rental waiting on us. "
"   Salt Lake City to Paris. Last time for me to fly Delta. Yes, they provide a comparatively cheap fare from Germany to the US, but on both legs (to and from US) technical troubles with the plane (to US: engine; from US: autopilot) led to substantial delays. Badly enough, the information policy on the ground was non-existent (""just don't go anywhere and wait until we board"") and on my way back my luggage was lost at Paris CDG airport and arrived three days later. Even though the Business Class product is not bad considering the price, the planes (old Boeing 767/757's) are run down and the two technical issues described above are certainly related to the fact that this airline strives at still flying 20+ year old planes on main routes."
"   Salt Lake City to Raleigh Durham on DL1846. Paid for business class ticket and gate agent gave it away to someone else when I was in the terminal, on my way to the gate (using restroom -- sometimes you gotta go), more than 10 minutes before departure. When I arrived, the gate agent essentially said ""too bad, I can do what I want"" with a big ""forget you"" to a very loyal customer. I guess 650,000+ miles in the last five years doesn't mean much to these guys."
"   San Antonio to Cusco via Dallas / Lima. I experienced a total of 3 flight delays out of 6 flights on our recent vacation. The total delay time was 27 hours. When I arrived in Lima from Dallas I was told my connecting ticket did not exist - I was told my ticket, and the ticket of my wife, that we had paid for, did not exist. I was then directed by Latam airlines (connecting airlines) to an American Airlines office; sadly no one was working at this office at 4 pm. I was then directed to call a local number; no one answered the line. I then used my cell phone to make an hour long international call, costing me 100 dollars (I have the bill) for my flight to be rescheduled for 10 hours later. So, 2 nights later, with about 6 hours total sleep time, my wife and I arrived at our final destination. The trip took 36 hours instead of 12. Of course, this completely changed our plans, cost me money, and caused me to experience a health problem. When I described my travel difficulties to an American Airlines representative, I was told that there were no guidelines that would fulfill my request for a refund. I was told that these types of problems, including forgetting to schedule a connecting flight when the original flight is delayed, are within what is considered normal operating procedures. I was awarded a number of airline miles. I have never experienced this kind of service. I have never written an online review of an airline. And I will never fly this airline again. The photo shows a throng of delayed passengers in Dallas after the first of 3 delays (this one 10 hours) - the airline sent us all to the same two hotels. Because the shuttles only held 11 people, and ran every 45 minutes, it took some passengers 3 hours to get from the Dallas Airport to the Super 8!"
   San Antonio to Dallas. I was charged a seat change fee of 30.50 when there was nothing saying that there would be an upcharge. I called to see how to fix this and the lady was very rude. She put me on hold for at least 2 minutes after getting frustrated with me because she didn't understand how to spell my name. Overall I'm extremely disappointed in the whole trip and experience.
"   San Antonio to Roanoke. Overall, American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can’t see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I’m a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn’t discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
"   San Diego to New York. I booked my tickets through Delta.com and there's an options between choosing Main Cabin (couple dollars more to pick the seats) and the regular Economy. Having paid a couple more dollars, I was able to secure seats for my family and me. I received a confirmation e-mail and everything looked good. It would've been the perfect vacation / honeymoon for me and my husband who got married a week before. Delta gave me the worst traveling experience ever. I bought a total of 16 tickets in the span of 2 weeks for me and my family.  I just want to sit next to my husband. I paid to achieve that. I reserved seats 32A and 32B, but when we went to check in, we got seats 35A and 34B.  I paid for a service and didn't get it. I was traveling with my mom and aunt as well as my husband, but because they left half way, I thought I just booked the seats and would've figured out seating arrangements amongst ourselves when we got on the plane. I realized that even though I reserved seats, I didn't get them. Who separates the newlyweds? You can count on Delta!"
   San Diego to Pittsburgh via Philadelphia. I am sorry for the poor review I am going to give. The staffs at the check in and the gates were rude and unprofessional. They focussed on charging 50 dollars for a carry on item. I do not mind paying if that's the rule and did so graciously. What matters most is the way 'ill trained' staff treat you. Sorry American Airlines. It used to be one of highly professional flights a few years ago. Good luck in recuperating the business. My last flight with them.
"   San Francisco to Atlanta in First Class on a B737-900ER. Delta provides its domestic First Class passengers with premium lane privileges at security but not the use of its lounge. The aircraft was quite new and the cabin was in good condition. Seats had enough width but limited incline, as is the norm on most US domestic carriers. Each seat was fitted with an interactive monitor that was responsive and state-of-the-art. On-board service was friendly and efficient, and the food served better than average. The in-flight wifi service through gogo was $33 for the duration of the flight, which is ridiculous, but I still bought it. The lavatory was unusually small and given that this pane was just 2.6 years old, I wonder why they had to make it this uncomfortable. On the whole, a comfortable flight."
"   San Francisco to Atlanta. Thank you Delta for your patience and understanding during our flight today. My son had a panic attack regarding flying and the flight attendants went out of their way to try to calm him for the remaining of the flight. They offered food, drinks, and headphones to calm him. They continued to check on us and was very patient. I can't thank you enough."
"   San Francisco to Charlotte via Grand Rapids. I started my day off by a missed flight. I guess I have not flown American in a long time. Most airlines put you on the next available flight when you miss a flight. American they put you on stand by for each leg of your flight. Or charge you $200 to reconfirm plus a $200 up charge. I was at SFO for 16 hours I had to pay $75 to grab another flight even though I paid $950 for 2 one-way flights just 24 hours prior. American customer service team members were the worst, they must train them to have a blank face and not care at all. The counter reps in SFO all could care less about helping at all. The reps I spoke with at the gate were too busy to care. I am not a fan of this airline. Basically is took 24 plus hours to get to somewhere that other airlines can get done in 6 hours and have a smile."
"   San Francisco to Miami. After my sister missed her first flight due to a car accident on the way to the airport, I was able to book a flight for her via American Airlines, I was emailed confirmation and she was emailed the boarding pass. When the plane was about to board the flight agent denied her ticket and put her on standby. They told her they could not find her reservation and even though she had a boarding pass they still denied her. When I called AA to talk to someone about this issue I was told ""its in our records she was late for the flight."" However this is a lie as my sister was waiting at the airport for 3 hours waiting to get onto that flight. I was not only told that my sister was ""lying"" but that ""didn't know what to tell me.""  I will never fly AA."
"   San Francisco to New York JFK. Delayed flight again, 3 hours this time. I hate flying Delta and this is the last time I will fly Delta. I was forced to use Delta this time. You would figure a major airline like Delta would have figured out how to be on time. Hawaiian Airlines hardly ever has delayed flights. "
"   San Francisco to New York JFK. More often than none, passengers bash the airline that failed to meet their personal expectations. There are so many components that go into air travel that it becomes trite to focus on event that left a bad taste. So, this review is to extol American Airlines. Checking in at SFO was quick and easy and the women who placed the luggage on the belt was charming. The Admirals Club was staffed by friendly workers and the morning display of food was more than enough to satisfy even a picky traveler. The Aircraft is amazing as is the business class seats. The FAs were professional, warm, friendly, and proud to be serving the customer. The food was as good as the service. IFE was outstanding. This was one of the best flights I have taken. American is doing what they do best. Perhaps it is the route that warrants this service. "
   San Francisco to Springfield via Dallas. Do not fly American if you have a choice. I am currently stuck in the Dallas airport because I could not run across airport fast enough. My first flight was 34 minutes late due to its departure from Dallas. We land in Dallas I run ( yes as people made comments about me running). I get to the gate before listed departure but 7 minutes after flight is closed. The funniest part is took me 6 minutes to get from gate to gate but I was 7 minutes late and I couldn't run fast enough? WTF I don't know or have ever seen someone run so fast time went backwards-have you? They didn't hold flight 1 minute for me even though they knew I was there trying to get on flight but running late because of them American not me. Basically flights with connections are just bait to get your money when they don't care about you. Then the 2nd flight is with an American partner (American Eagle) who says there is nothing they can do for me as my reason for missing the flight is not there fault but can get me a discount hotel room for $100 a night and put me on the first flight in the morning. Now I'm stuck in an airport for 12 hours. 
"   San Jose to Atlanta. I have seen a lot of service on airplanes, good and bad. This service before the boarding was by far the worst experience in a long time. Online Check In didn't work due to technical issues, no seats available at check in to sit next to each other. Even three hours before. Exit was available but didn't give us without charge. No customer service as I expect. Was supposed to ask at gate, waited 20 Min and the answer was ""No, flight full. Next please"". Very rude and not friendly at all. A good explanation would be fine. Was questioned by employee about visit to Costa Rica without letting me know about the reasons for his questions. Don't recommend this airline. Bad service, rude behavior."
   San Juan to Miami. I have never been so disappointed with an airline. I am actually sitting and waiting to be boarded on a standby flight. I checked in 1 minute after the one hour mark was told that nothing could be done. I am here with 5 other families including my own that all arrived here at the same time. Even families with no luggage were not permitted to board. I watched them give my ticket away to people in standby once I got to the gate. This is ridiculous.
"   Sao Paulo to Los Angeles. Haven't flown AA for many years and had read reviews that made it sound bad. Turned out we had a very nice experience. As an Alaska MVP Gold, we got Main Cabin Extra seats- the increase in pitch from 31"" to 35"" made a huge difference during the 12 hour flight. Seats were reasonably comfortable, plane was clean and entertainment system had decent options. Took off at 10:30p (on time) and shortly after, flight attendants came through with drinks and a dinner service. Wine choice was decent and food was as well. Portions were small but for us just right to sit for 12 hours. FA's came through and picked up quickly and cabin lights dimmed for sleep. Flight attendants were very nice, efficient. Had a nice talk with one of them- this route takes more than 20 years seniority with AA but FA's were engaged and helpful. I asked for a head set for the entertainment system and one of them remembered and found one for me. All in all a good experience. Landed at LAX at the American terminal and had a long hike to the International terminal to go through customs. Baggage showed up promptly and in good condition. American did a nice job- certainly up to any of the other US airlines.
"
"   Scheduled departure was at 9.10am. Departed at 10.15am because of paperwork issues. Upon entry into the plane it was filthy. Potato chip crumbs on my seat, oily screen, urine all over floor/toilet in bathroom which leads me to believe the plane was never kept or cleaned before our boarding. At 11.43am we were still on the tarmac and they said that something mechanical was wrong with the plane. We then returned to the gate. It is now 1.36pm and we have reboarded the plane. We still have not left. They are saying that they still have no further information. On top of that, the crew have asked us to have sympathy for them. Delta is laughable. I don't have sympathy for the crew. I have sympathy for everyone who has been patiently keeping their cool and have missed their connecting flights and their cruises. "
"   Seats were terrible for first class. It is ridiculous that Delta has sardine canned in people in first class, this is coach, not first. We are in seat 1C/D, and there is no legroom whatsoever, I just walked back to coach, and the first seats in coach have more leg room than our seats. Our seats recline the same as coach or less, maybe 2 inches at that. This is not worth the money, better to sit in emergency row exit in Coach. We had to wait for about 20 people who said they needed ""more time"" to board the plane before they called first class, and most of the people who lined up to get on the plane first looked absolutely fine to us. This is so ridiculous. For the money we paid they should allow us at least to get on the plane first ."
"   Seattle to Chicago. This is the worst flight I can recall in decades of flying American and other airlines, and I was flying in First Class. The plane was old, the toilet was not kept clean during the flight. The female flight attendant sat strapped in and facing us mid-flight and ate, after which we were given nothing. We arrived at 5:55am without being offered juice or coffee prior to landing. We were to be given ""snacks"" plural but got only one snack serving at the start of the flight and nothing during the rest of the time. We had no brewed coffee available. The flight attendants' uniforms looked as though they had slept in when we boarded the plane. This was the most class-less First Class. The air quality was also poor. There was a strange smell when we got on, and it did not dissipate. You could choose to close air vents or endure cold air blasting down on your head. The equipment should be replaced and so should the crew. The seats are hard and barely recline.  We were on time and had a safe flight. That's all that matters in the end, but choice of airlines is competitive."
"   Seattle to Incheon with Delta. I paid to upgrade to economy plus. I had seat 19B (an aisle seat). I am a good size guy and fit in my seat with room to spare, but the guy who Delta sat in 19A was twice as wide as me and took up half my seat. The plane was overbooked, so no changing seats. The seat divider could not come down because his leg was in the way. It was an 11 hour flight having to cuddle with a guy in the seat next to me. My suggestion is if passengers look big have a trial seat to have them sit in. If the don't fit make them buys 2 tickets. This was not a good flight."
"   Seattle to Knoxville via Dallas. I'm writing this review while sitting in the terminal in Dallas. Our flight out of Seattle was delayed, but we still made it in time to make our connection in Dallas if we ran like maniacs to the next terminal, which we did. When we got to our gate, with 5 minutes to spare, the doors were already closed. The plane sat there for at least 20 more minutes. We were told during our flight that they often held flights for 10 minutes when a flight like our with so so many connecting flights was late. Not only not only not held, but it was shut early! Thanks American! We were booked on a later flight without a hint of an apology or an explanation. Again thanks American! We'll get home at after 4:00 am. Thanks American! Do you have computers? Can you see connecting flights just landed? Do you care? Can you be polite to your customers?"
"   Seattle to Los Angeles. First the planes--thus gates--were switched last minute. Shuttled across the airport and boarded to find that we were delayed because they had to verify the switch (due to a faulty turbo needed for Alaska but not Los Angeles) and because we had too much fuel (again, needed for Alaska not LA). Then because during the now 90 min wait with no air conditioning on a 85+ degree day* we'd used gas from one side of the plane and not the other so it had to be siphoned over. Amazing crew of flight attendants gave us water for the heat and encouraged us to file official complaints. But that 1/2 glass of ice-less water each used up the entire flight's supply. Lots of unhappy flyers, crew, and missed connections."
"   Seattle to New York with Delta Air Lines. My husband and I were extremely unhappy with the lack of food service on this transcontinental flight. We paid for Premium Economy with the understanding that there would be complimentary food included. I asked at the gate to be sure and was told we didn't have to bring any food on board. To add insult to injury, there is food included on flights to California. What kind of nonsense is this? The movie selection was only mediocre, in addition. We're not eager to fly Delta again, and we do make frequent trips to Seattle because we have family there. We're not giving Delta a good review with our friends either."
"   Seattle to Phoenix. As a first time Delta flyer, I was nervous because of bad reviews I've seen. But in reality, the airline was great. From the gate person to the customer service, all was excellent. The only bad thing was that I got off with sore knees because economy is not very accommodating for anyone above 5 foot 6. So if you're above average height, you may want to save up for First Class for that extra leg room. But otherwise, Delta was great!"
"   Seattle to Portland. I have never experienced such a nightmare travel experience. Of the 4 flights we took, including connecting flights, every single plane was delayed or changed last minute - not even related to weather. I spent more hours in airports and on phones and in lines with Delta customer service over this 10 day vacation than I ever care to again. And the compensation for the first leg of the flight was minimal and wasn't even offered until after several hours on the phone and we had to make the request. Delta was the only airline with lines longer than space available for lines on both legs of the trip, so clearly it's a consistent and internal issue. Unapologetic customer service, late to connecting flights, missing entire days of a vacation stuck in airports. Not where I'd like to spend my money ever again."
"   Seattle to Quito via Dallas. For about a year, we planned a trip to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu, and bought round trip airline tickets on American Airlines. The night before our flight (flight departing morning of 8/5/17), we printed boarding passes. At approximately 10PM we received a non-urgent email from American stating: please call to rebook your flight. No other info given. We almost overlooked the email because of the lack of urgency and the fact that we already had our boarding passes. When we called we were informed our entire trip to Equador was cancelled due to ground conditions. I called both airports we would be landing at and they reported no delays or ground conditions. American Airlines would not tell us what the ground conditions were. The night they cancelled, American Airlines only offered to move us to a flight on American leaving 48 hours later which would not get us to our destination for 4 days. (Our original flight would get us there in just over 24 hours.) They would not put us on a flight with another airline, which were available. They did not apologize and treated us like we were wasting there time. We were told we would not be given any compensation for the loss of 4 days of our trip. I called other airlines myself, in the middle of the night, and booked us on Delta (for flights that would get us to our destination on time,) but had to pay $4500 out of pocket. Delta got us to our destination on time and with no ground condition delays. We landed at the same time our original flight was scheduled to land. Upon return from our trip, we tried to contact customer relations at American to get a refund. There was no phone number, so we wrote an email and waited for a call. A day later, a representative notified us we would be getting no compensation for our losses. She gave a cursory ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" She gave us no further support and would not transfer us to a superior. She actually rose her voice with us when we asked to speak to someone else and said she had the authority to make these decisions. There are no phone numbers for customer service, refunds, or managers. Approximately 1 month after our cancelled flight, we finally received a refund of $1680 for the cost of the flight that was cancelled, but we were not compensated for the $4500 we lost. We felt that each person we talked to was unhelpful and even rude at times. We understand that flights can get cancelled but expect to be helped onto another flight in a timely manner or compensated for our losses. At the very least we should have an explanation of why our trip was cancelled. American did none of these and we will never fly with them again"
"   Seoul Incheon to San Francisco via Seattle. I used to be a Medallion member. But, moved to the west coast and due to lack of direct flights to some cities from OAK, I have not flew Delta in recent years. I flew from ICN to SFO today after two flights with Asian airlines. What a difference. Delta's seat were so hard, I thought I was setting on the granite. Cold, old and hard! Food was awful. Service, I can't understand why people pay their money to fly Delta. They were serving food and drinks as we were in a soup kitchen. Throwing everything on the table and ""we are out of everything"". Was really bad. Even Chinese airlines are better than Delta."
"   Shanghai to Chicago. Business Class Service. Check in at Pudong smooth. Lounge available was Air China's First Class Lounge B71. Ample hot food available, good selection of beverages and also a bar service. Papers available as well. Nothing special compared to other First Class Lounges, but a freebie. Boarding was about 1 hour early. Orderly and smooth. Had seat 7A on the return. Second Business class cabin on board. Kind of Cozy. Seat 7A was excellent. Seemed like a lot more space, was not anchored with another passengers chair and comfortable enough that I slept for 7 hours... Flight attendants were attentive and friendly. Food service was ok. Taste of the seafood platter was bland, nothing to write home about. FA' came by often, but didn't ask if you'd like refills, just browsed by unless you asked. Did offer a meal before landing, but it was cold and not impressed. Overall a better experience than I expected and they are trying to compete with the Asian Carriers, but they have some room to improve. With that said, I still try them again. "
"   Shannon to Columbus via New York. My family and I  flew internationally and Delta refused to move us to an earlier connecting flight, despite the fact that we had plenty of time and they told us the earlier flight had plenty of seats.  To make us even more mad, they said ""if it was one of you we could do it, but not for a family."" So, I can only conclude that Delta hates families? Or they're just lazy? I'm mad that I have to sit in the airport for 6 more hours. How is Delta so stupid? Now there are less seats on the later flight to possibly sell, and they just chose to anger five international travelers who have families of their own. Way to simultaneously screw your customers and yourself, Delta. We won't be back. I gave them a 1/10 instead of a 0/10 because the flight crew on our first leg of the trip was great."
"   So disappointing. We've used Delta for international travel many times and had no problems. Internal US domestic travel has been so different. First of all they took our hand luggage off us and told us they had to check them. If we weren't prepared and had a smaller bag each we would of had to scramble and find something to put our essentials in as they didn't care and said there's no room, they need to be checked in. We had a multi leg flight but were told we wouldn't be allowed our luggage for any of the flights even though there might be room on the last flight. The flights themselves were fine, friendly staff and relatively on time. Just minutes late nothing bad. The next night is when we land at Daytona, the last flight and one of our bags doesn't turn up. Luckily an agent was still on site and told us that unfortunately the bag didn't get on the flight at Denver and that instead of being sent to Atlanta they sent it to Minneapolis. The bag is ""hopefully"" going to be on the 11am flight tomorrow which we have to go and pick up ourselves! If not they've told us it's going to be a problem as we are moving resorts everyday as we are on a touring holiday. Sorry Delta but that's not my problem, you ruined our first night in Florida."
"   St Louis to Aruba via Miami. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I received an email two days prior to my flight back home that my flight was cancelled. I called the airline to see if they can get me on another flight as I needed to get home. They had plenty of flights going out of Aruba the following two days but insisted on getting me on a flight that was 5 days later. The agent I spoke to was not helpful what so ever. I explained to her that the other airlines were still operating and asked if they could take care of my ticket with another airline, that was denied. At one point the supervisor got on the line and said to me ""I am not sure why you are wasting your time talking to us when you could be booking a ticket with another airline."" If all flights were cancelled I would have understood, but only mine was. Which really frustrated me, if you cannot fly into that specific airport, reroute the flight and fly into one that you can. Simple. The supervisor got very rude and asked me if I had the ability to make the airplane magically appear. I mean I could go on forever about the awful customer service I received from American Airlines. "
"   St. Louis to Chicago. I’m completely devastated. My husband and I have been married for three years, but we never had a honeymoon. So we saved up our money to decide where we would go within the next five years. He had to have major surgery, so we scheduled for this year. He’s never flown before and was excited and anxious. We made a reservation with Carnival Cruise to coincide with our anniversary but before his surgery, because life is short. Everything was fine as we filled up our Expedition for the two hour drive to Lambert Airport. We found parking and got on the park shuttle. I knew a little bit from prior experience, but my husband was worried and nervous. The first thing out of place I noticed was when we were at the gate waiting to board. The captain and crew got on about ten minutes before we were called to board. There was a request for anyone with a carryon with wheels to check them at the desk due to a full plane. As we boarded I noticed the captain laughing and holding a conversation with two flight attendants already aboard. Then the problems started. It took a while because the flight attendants were trying to find space overhead for everyone’s carry-ons (we didn’t have any.) The captain taxied off, then stopped. He told us we had to wait awhile for the plane to be de-iced. (That took 50 minutes.)  He taxied again and went around three times. Finally, he told us that his compass wasn’t aligned and he needed to have maintenance take a look at it. But, there was no gate available, so we would have to wait until one opened for him to dock. (That took another 30 minutes.) During this wait, one of the female flight attendants told us to call or go online to rebook if we had connecting flights out of Chicago. I called immediately and was told by a representative she could not rebook us while we were still on the plane. I explained that we needed to catch our connecting flight from Chicago at 8:30am and if we missed it we would miss our cruise. Absolutely no sympathy given. Finally we docked. After 30 more minutes of uncertainty, the captain told us the plane is being put out of service. I called the cruise line for help to get to our port in Miami, while my husband called American Airlines to see what can be done. We got off the plane and was told little to no info. We asked where our luggage would be and told it would be held until we had another flight. The rep found us another flight, but it would make it there after the cruise had already departed. Mind you, one flight had already boarded and ready to leave at 7:19am. Too bad we were stuck on the tarmac. The cruise line couldn’t find a plane for us because all flights were booked and full. We made several phone calls trying to salvage our delayed honeymoon to no avail. Finally, we accepted defeat and requested a refund and looked for our luggage. This turned into another time consuming ordeal. We drove back home dejected. It was a very quiet two hour drive. We had a million questions and no answers. I called the cruise line as soon as we got home to see if we could book another one. I found one sailing 3/16/17 after working with a remarkable woman. Unfortunately, there were no flights available. I accepted defeat once again and was given options that made it worse. I couldn't add the rest of the letter I sent them both. "
"   Stuttgart to Atlanta. Delta Air Lines messaged early morning about a flight delay which was appreciated. Flight had been oversold and when checking in online I was offered the opportunity to volunteer. Flight was completely full including a large bulldog used as a ""comfort dog."" Cabin crew was somewhat senior but gracious, in the aisles to assist passengers as they boarded. Service began quickly and the welcoming attitudes continued with flight attendants engaging with passengers as services were offered. While there is nothing specific to tag as having made the flight good, it just was. Everything - food, entertainment, staff availability, even the seat - was comfortable. Delta economy class service outshines their SkyTeam partners and this flight was a perfect example."
"   Sydney to New York via Los Angeles. Booked a seat, Oh no a ticket on the plane it was not a seat as I was told, even though you have to pay to get a better seat it's just still a ticket. Ordered Vegetarian for my daughter for return flights as she does not eat meat. On the way over they told her nothing was ordered and were the most rudest people to her about it, they offered her nothing to eat as an alternative and actually told her go and complain about it! So I called the office and let them know of their staff’s rudeness and that on a 15 hour long haul flight she was starving! They ensured me that they had it arranged for the return flight and I also upgraded her seat to give her an exit row seeing she is tall to give her more leg room. Yes the meal this time was correct, the staff though were the same rude people, must be a trait for AA. But her seat was broken, - they offered her nowhere else to move told her once again go complain. I have since read so many bad reviews, that I wished I had read before making the booking. It was a special trip for my daughters birthday to NYC to see her sister. American Airlines Customer service is the worst she had ever encountered in her life she said, you should maybe put some money into training your staff if they are having a bad day, which seems to be every day do not take it out on your paying customers as they are the ones who will not return."
"   Tallahassee to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. We are the only ones in priority check in just to be ignored while employees are having a great time talking and laughing. Then the one employee checking coach class customers helped 2 other customers while we felt like fools for paying first class prices. All was well and the 1st class cabin was comparable to competitors. Food was a disgrace. Service was good. White wine was served warm with no apologies. On our return again ignored while standing in priority check in while watching coach class customers jump ahead. Again food was a disgrace. This time the stewardess did say the white wine was not yet cold. And gave us the option of warm or waiting a while for it to chill. While waiting to board in DFW we ask if there would be a meal served. Trying to decide if we needed to purchase and carry on something for lunch. To our surprise neither of the 2 AA employees knew and had no idea how to find out. I guess my biggest problem is that first class prices should be supported with first class service and food. Our expectations are based on Delta's 1st class service. Pre flight video wasted no time bragging about being the largest airline with 6700 planes. And yes that's impressive, But please note, I can only fly in one plane at a time and really expect that flight to compare to the airlines with less than 6700 planes.  AA, clean up your first class service."
   Tampa to Amsterdam via Boston. Worst experience ever. I had a 50 hours delay. Delta was not helpful what so ever. There were hunderds of people at Tampa Airport and only one Delta employee to find flghts. I was forced to stay two extra days in Tampa. They rebooked and cancelled 4 times my flights. I am still waiting for a refund for the premium economy seats I paid for but was not able to use. Also I had to do a lot of talking before they would give me hotel vouchers for the two extra nights. I had to book a hotel myself. Never saw so many frustrated travellers. Delta was not able to handle the situation.
"   Tampa to Palm Springs via Charlotte / Phoenix. I ordered my ticket through FlightHub, all flights were cancelled and Tampa airport was closed the night before my departure, because of hurricane Irma. I've been trying to reach FlightHub for over three weeks now to get a refund for my flight, but it was impossible to get through to them via phone. Whenever I called, it keep disconnecting me or they pretend on the other side that they can't hear me, and disconnect. I called AA and they were unable to help me, because the reservation was made through FlightHub agency, so FlightHub is who I need to go through. I called FlightHub again, and after 3 weeks I was finally able to connect with them. They kept me on the phone for 3 hours, going back and forth with American Airlines - finally AA announced that my ticket is not eligible for refund! It is close to $500 that they are refusing to refund and I would understand if the circumstances were different, but the cancellation due to natural disaster should be refunded no matter what. Shame on you American Airlines."
   Tampa to Springfield via Dallas. Terrible airline. I left Springfield on 12/30 and arrived at airport at 2.10 pm for my 3.20 pm flight to Dallas connecting to a flight to Tampa. Plane delayed 3 hours and 15 minutes in Springfield. Finally a rescue plane came from Chicago and flew us to Dallas. I missed my connecting flight and there were no flights until 12/31. No agent to assist with meals or accommodations at Dallas. I was confirmed on 7.15 am flight which was cancelled. Now waiting to see if the 9am flight will actually leave. Once AA sent me a confirmation for the next morning flight I attempted to book a seat and was charged $40.66 for a total of 7 attempts. Got an exit row seat for $48 and change. Had already upgraded on my missed flight on 12/30. Spent the night at hotel and paid my own meals. I will hope to never travel on American again and I definitely don’t recommend this airline. I called customer service and they would not help with accommodations they offered a travel co for a discount. Lousy service.
"   The American Airlines staff in the Akron Canton airport were incredibly polite and helpful. My flight with Southwest was delayed which meant I would not catch my connecting flight to Las Vegas. American Airlines was exceptionally courteous, especially about my emotional support dog, who travels with me everywhere. They were happy to greet and pet my dog and she was pleasantly invited into all three flights I had to take home. All other airlines I have flown with were not so pleasant about my dog flying with me. I was met with positivity and an excellent level of customer service from every employee. Thank you so much for easing what would have been a very stressful travel day. I will fly with AA again!"
"   The flight attendants on my Delta flight going to Atlanta and returning home to Newark were some of the most caring I have seen. They took the time to make sure I was doing ok when I was having a tough time with my assigned seat and the flights. They went above and beyond expectations, and I am grateful for them during a rough time. "
"   The flight was delayed in Paris for 4 hours plus the 3 hours layover so 7 hours, then we came to New York and that's where the worst happened. The flight was delayed three times then was canceled, and no hotels for us. I had to spend the night and the day there sleeping on the floor next to the exit of the airport cause they won't let you enter to the gate. I arrived to San Francisco I waited 1 hour to collect my baggage and I found out that they only sent one - the other one is hanging out in New York. Thank you delta for making my experience horrible."
"   The last time I have flown American Airlines was in 1994, it will take a lot longer to wipe out this horrible memory, I was flying American to connect with a Qatar Airways flight to Doha. It was an early morning flight 06.55 so we checked in at 4 am, the horrible American Airlines check in staff refused to issue the connecting flight Qatar Airways boarding pass, even though it was one ticket and both are part of One World, he even lied and claimed falsely that Qatar Airways have withdrawn from One World. Boarding was smooth and the whole way to New York I was trying to be nice to the cabin attendants and smiling to them and all they had was a straight face!"
"   The new interior cabin updates seem to ""look"" nice, however, it is clear that whoever designed this has never worked on an aircraft. The lavatories walls are so narrow it would be very difficult for anyone over 190 lbs to manoeuvre freely. Not only are the lavatories almost half the size, the space has cut into the galley so that now you feel terrible standing in the way of flight attendants with no where to stand that is not inhibiting either other passengers or the attendants. The staff were warm and friendly, but they too confessed these updates were difficult for them becuase they can no longer even see when passengers request assistance or have questions from their seats. The call lights are too low on the overhead space for attendants to see and there has been zero adjustment on leg space and comfort for passengers. In addition there was no inflight entertainment on a 5 hour flight. After this terrible experience, I have now been struggling to return home to Los Angeles from my work trip to Louisville, due to Delta's system crashing, their apparent logical response to the thousands of passengers stranded is to prolong and cancel even more flights putting the issue off. At some point all these people are going to have to fly home, cancelling more flights due to overcrowded scheduling is actually making the problem worse. While I have time to afford not going back to work immediately (since I haven't been able to get home yet and this is now the third flight I've finally been able to snag a seat) there were dozens of military at ticketing with no flight options out so that they could arrive and report for duty and training. I feel for the ticketing staff, attendants and all else who work for Delta who are not responsible for this mess, as they are the ones reaping the overworked hours and disgruntled travelers. "
"   The two changes of aircraft to Memphis was not what we originally booked hence a very long tiring travel to holiday. The landing and take offs were excellent. The cabin crew did not look smart and tidy which was very disturbing especially with the females hair looking unruly, long and untidy and serving food. I was an air stewardess in my younger days and since travelled with a number of airlines with their cabin crew being smart and well presented. American Airlines female crew looked scruffy, nor all wearing same uniform. I was sad to see below standard stewardesses who represent the airline. We certainly had a loss of expectation from such a large airline.
"
"   The worst customer service from American Airlines flying from New Orleans to Dallas. These people have no respect for the passengers. There is no one to talk to. They checked in my husband's and my carry-on bags at the gate due to the limited space in the cabin (even though each of us had one personal item and small carry on) they promised that they would return us the baggage in Dallas as we had to stay over night because of the connection. We arrived but the baggage wasn't there. They sent us from Terminsl C to Terminal D to receive the baggage. Arriving at the baggage claim area, there was a staff member who wasn't willing to help at all. He was calling some customer service counter where nobody was available pretending that he was doing something. As I was furious, we asked for a supervisor, then he called someone else, again we had to repeat the story. Anyway, after 4 hours of waiting in the airport we received our bag and could finally leave to the hotel to get some rest. In the morning, went back to the airport for the next flight, asked for a supervisor. The lady wasn't even willing to talk to us. She was looking around as we were complaining and stopped us saying you only talk about ""negatives"" I can't do anything about it. There was 3 other people with different problems over there. Awful service! Last time travelling with them."
"   The worst nightmare flight I've ever been on. My flight from Las Vegas to Minneapolis was delayed one hour because they overbooked it. This delay set in motion a series of missed connection that made me travel for 2 days to my final destination! I was supposed to travel from Minneapolis to Paris but we were one hour late because they took of one hour late from Las Vegas. Not only that but when I arrived at the gate in Minneapolis they closed it 20 minutes prior to departure (the cut off time is 10 minutes) and forbade us to get on board. I'm pretty sure they ovebooked that flight and gave away our seats or sold them. It was 15 of us about 3 or 4 families with children and old people but they didnt care.They treated us like animals and called security on us when we asked to talk to the person in charge. Then they told us very dryly to go to the help desk where actually nobody was actually help you. They just gave you a phone number and let you solve your own problem so I was forced to stay on the phone for over one hour to try to rebook my flight and repair their mistake. I had to spent one night in Minneapolis and the next day they flew us to Salt Lake City where I had to spend 8 hours in the airport; the flight to Europe was delayed again 3.5 hours so by the time I arrived in Europe I missed my connection again so they rebooked me on a flight to Paris from Amsterdam. That plane too left one hour later than scheduled and my final plane had another hour delay to my final destination to Bucharest. All in all I had to change 5 planes and it took me 2 days and 4 hours to get to Bucharest from Las Vegas traveling with 3 minor children and a 72 years old. This is by far the worst airline I ever had to deal with and I will never fly Delta again. They were extremely rude and unhelpful, didn't care that it was their fault; they would lie to our faces that they are aware of our delay and we were already rebooked on a different flight. I had to do everything myself and run around in 5 different airports with children and luggage."
"   There's always one carry on allowed to be carried to the plane. I fly with this airline a lot. Last time when I was flying back to Hartford from Dallas airport, they did not let me take my carry on with me to the plane and told me it was bigger size than usual. However I always take the same carry on to the plane and have never had any problems. They checked it in and when I entered the airplane I saw a lot of empty spaces on the overhead container and I saw carry ons that were much fatter and wider than my carry on. I had to wait 30 minutes after arrival to the airport to get my carry on back from baggage claim! It was such a waste of time when I could have easily carried it with me to the plane. I got home at 2 am that night! "
"   This flight was booked through Virgin but they didn't do flights from Manchester to New York, so they use Delta Air Lines. My daughter and I were sat on seats behind the seats where the exits were and it was very cold as is usual. The blankets provided were not adequate to keep out the cold even though we had a couple each. The seatbelt sign was on for a while after take off but people were walking up and down and the staff didn't say anything to them. The exit area was blocked with litter but the staff did not make any attempt clear it away. The food was not worth eating, it was cold, dry and hard. I felt as though I was flying with a second rate airline, the cabin staff didn't speak and look thoroughly miserable. Not a good experience flying with Delta."
"   This is my 4th and last reservation with Delta. The prior 3 reservations were all late, I missed my connections and had to wait hours for the next plane. The last straw was today 8/14/17. My son is in the military and is coming home on leave. Delta decides to delay a plane with approximately 25 people for 3 hours because ""a flight attendant got lost"". So needless to say, my son missed his first connection, now will miss the second connection (and last flight to Florida by the way) and now has to stay at the airport until the next flight after 8am tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, that is how Delta rewards our men and women who serve in the military. "
"   This was a very frustrating experience. There was a delay of three hours in Charlotte. There were four delays (and reschedulings) in all. There was very little explanation given for the delays. For the second delay, the passengers had actually completely boarded, and then we were told to disembark. When we finally got on the plane - three hours late, the pilot gave a very brief (and disingenuous) apology and then said, ""Well, it is what it is."" The rest of the flight staff never apologized, nor did anyone at any time offer anything in the way of a perk (food, beverage, etc.) or mention anything about any compensation for passengers. This is the very last time I fly American. "
"   This was an awful experience. American Airlines ""business class"" is a rip off. Given the choice just a few hours before boarding to ""upgrade"" to business class for $80 USD for the first leg of my journey, I thought it seemed like a good idea - wrong! My $80 upgrade bought me a slightly larger seat and 1 premium beer! There was no food, other than a snackbar served on the 4-hour flight between Merida and Miami, and then when I had a 3-hour layover in Miami before getting my connecting fight, my first class ticket wouldn't even give me access to the premium lounge, which was the principal reason I had upgraded! This was a total rip-off and maddening."
"   Though a frequent traveler this was my first experience with Delta flying from New Orleans to San Antonio via Atlanta. I found the staff courteous and professional. The aircraft carrier was very clean and comfortable. Unfortunately on my return the flight schedule got botched up because of bad weather in Atlanta. I had an international flight early the next morning, I went up to the service person who was prompt and courteous to re route me via Houston. He put me on United Airlines and I reached my destination 1 hour ahead of my actual itinerary. "
"   Tokyo Haneda to Los Angeles. Bad food, bad service, always delayed. Not worth the money. I'd rather take asian airlines for international flights.  Not worth your money. Again not even comfortable. Never for a more than 5 hour flight."
"   Tokyo Narita to Chicago return. I had apprehensions but prices were lower than Asian carriers with significantly shorter travel time including domestic connection in Japan. Online check in for feeder flights with Japan Airlines not possible, but could change and select seat for longhaul both ways. Window on the way there, legroom rather tight as mentioned in other reviews, but bearable as seats are slim (I am 6'6"" or almost 2m). On the way back, had an aisle seat but a crew member was nice enough to let me sit on 18K/L which were both unoccupied. While most crew members just did the bare necessary, service was overall fine, and especially on the way back some of the crew were genuinely friendly and seemed to enjoy their work, especially the more senior crew members, contrary to what I expected from other reviews. Food was alright (except for horrible, cold, way too salty mid-flight sandwiches) somewhat better out of NRT, soft drinks, wine, and several beers free. Three drink rounds per meal were plenty. Entertainment system responsive and with good choice, all flights on time. Can't find much fault with AA overall and would fly them again for the right price."
"   Tokyo Narita to Detroit on the Boeing 747-400. First time flying with Delta Air Lines and having very low expectations with US carriers, I was surprised with Delta. The food, IFE, and ameneties provided were much better than expected. The two veteran crew serving my side were really friendly and interactive with passengers. The crew on the opposite aisle were grumpy and not smiling."
"   Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta / Paris. I was on a 3 day trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to meet my family, my sister came from London and brother came from Sri Lanka to meet me. I bought the ticket with KLM, but the flight was cancelled and they reschedule my ticket with Delta. My bags were checked in at Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta and Paris. However, from the beginning, I had bad experiences, at the check in desk two ladies refused to let me board saying that I do not have a valid visa to travel to France even though I produce them my Danish resident permit which is valid for all Schengen states. They simply gave my passport back saying that I cannot travel to France without a valid visa. (I am a Sri Lankan passport holder with a Danish resident permit). I had to speak to their supervisor, and he issued the boarding passes to only to Paris. Enquired him about the boarding pass from Paris to Copenhagen, he said I can get it from the machine once I arrived in Paris. When I arrived in Paris I tried to print my boarding pass, but I was not able to print it due to the fact that they find my flight reservation CDG to CPH. I had to rush to Air France customer service, and they said Delta has not issued my ticket from CDG to CPH while rescheduling my ticket. After 20 minutes thanks to Air France staff they gave my boarding pass. Once I arrived in Copenhagen my baggage did not appear. Then I asked for assistance at CPH lost baggage services to locate my baggage, and they informed me that they have no record after Atlanta. They asked me to contact Delta customer services agents. I contacted them and they were simply reading back to me what is on the Delta website and asked me to wait or either file a lost baggage complain.  As per the telephone conversation with Delta baggage services on Saturday, they said they will deliver the baggage to my United States address as they do not have information regarding my baggage. Saturday the 10th December around 10.30pm they rang me and informed me that my baggage arrived at CPH and they are going to deliver it to my hotel. However, I could not hand over those to him as baggage was delivered to me around 11.00pm Danish time Saturday the 10th December, after my brother left Copenhagen. He flew back to Sri Lanka on the 10th December. I was really stressed out as I had to carry the Christmas gifts back to the US and I have no other way to deliver the gifts before Christmas. Moreover, I have to carry that 16kg back to Denmark next time. I asked them for extra compensation as they ruined my holiday as well as I have to find another way of sending the stuff to my family which I already bought for them. I don't think anyone would spend the US $1200 just for 3 days travel if the trip is not really important. Due to their mistake, my holiday was ruined and I could not fulfil the purpose of my travel. I am very disappointed with this Airline and I will avoid flying Delta again.."
"   Virginia Beach to Chicago via Charlotte. About 50-60% of the time there is an issue. Typically, a delay. My latest experience not only included a delay, a cancellation, and then a flight change to one full day later, it also included a 3 hour cluster-you-know-what of uncertainty as to where our baggage was. The ticket tracing system was completely usesless and when I attempted to speak to one of their robotic customer service reps, I was told that there was nothing that could be done and that my bags would be available the next day in Chicago. (We were trapped in Charlotte for the night). The issue is that at the time of flight change to make up for the cancellation, we were guaranteed by an AA rep that our baggage would be released upon arrival in Charollette. When trying to explain this to the baggage service rep, I was told I was wrong, and that nobody could go get the bag for over 5 hours. There are many more details surrounding the disrespectful way that the baggage claim rep handled the situation but my qualm is with the rip-off that is AA as an organization""."
"   Was due to fly from Asheville to St Louis via Atlanta. Kudos to ground staff of Delta Flight 5226 for working hard to get passengers revised flights after a delay. Staff were courteous, professional, patient, and went above and beyond to assist passengers. Thanks for the extra snacks and smiles. Delta folks in Asheville NC are top- notch."
"   Was due to fly from Buffalo to Minneapolis. My flight was cancelled one hour before the departure time, I then sat on hold for another hour before their phone system hung up on me. I would never recomend flying Delta to anyone, but since they are a large company it seems there is no other option. I dont understand why the customer service is so bad for such a large company. Delta wasted my time."
"   Washington DC to Houston via Atlanta. Delayed start at Washington DC due to technical snag. but Delta let the passengers out of aircraft into terminal and provided refreshments. Due to about 90 mins delayed departure, my connecting flight to Houston missed, but was pleasantly surprised upon landing they were prepared to lodge us overnight and give the next day connecting flight with an apology. Liked the overnight stay in Atlanta in Holiday Inn, following day was promptly picked up from hotel to airport. Overall satisfied with Delta hospitality and sensitivity."
"   Washington to Los Angeles. Thanks Delta. My boyfriend and I will check to book with Delta first for the air excellent choice they give customer's  - complimentary light dinner with 3 or 4 great choices, as well as snacks and beverage choices. We enjoyed the free headphones with a large selection of the latest movies and television shows, each seat has it's own tv. My boyfriend stated he is getting Delta Credit Card to earn flying points as well. Delta, thank you for treating us like human beings and not a cash machine. You stand out from the airlines want to nickel and dime and treat their customers as cash machines instead of human beings. "
   Washington to New York. Delta Air Lines a great for a short haul flight because they gave me what I expect. Although there was no food because it is only short haul I never felt bored. The seat was good and it has enough legroom. The cabin is clean and the flight attendant funny and very accommodating.
"   Washington to West Palm Beach via Atlanta. Just got off a flight where the flight attendants talked on the intercom almost the whole flight. And the volume was so loud my ears are ringing and I have a pounding headache. Never before have I been on such an annoying flight where you couldn't relax, rest, watch a movie, or read because of the incessant talking on the overhead announcer speaker about nothing. When we got off the plane, the person I was traveling with expressed the same frustration. The flights attendants need to shut up! I would much rather fly Southwest where you can actually enjoy your flight!"
"   We are happy to report an excellent experience with American Airlines. We took a long-anticipated vacation to D.C. and the flight there was on time and very nice to inexperienced travelers. The flight was good and we were comfortable. They handed out snacks and a drink to passengers. Unfortunately, our trip was cut short due to an unexpected death in the family. My mom had also been hospitalized after learning of the death, so I just wanted to get home asap. I called American Airlines to help change our plans for an emergency flight home, and the woman who helped us was so kind and patient as we were still reeling from the news and trying to make a decision whether to take an early flight with a layover or take one in the afternoon. They waived change fees that would have been over $400 and just charged us less than $20 for the difference in the ticket costs. The woman from American Airlines handled everything, and got us home at the earliest possible time we could get out. We are inexperienced fliers and have never had a transfer. The ticket agents helped us figure everything out. When our flight was delayed due to weather I started to panic for fear of missing out connecting flight, and the steward was so helpful and kind - The transfer ended up getting off and then getting back on the same plane so we didn't have to worry about missing the connecting plane! Thank you American Airlines - we felt like people, never like sheep. "
"   We booked our trip from Dallas to New York La Guardia in the spring. We received confirmation immediately. We received a notice for change of flight in October, with the same confirmation number. 2 days before our December 17th flight, received instructions to choose our seats. When my husband attempted to choose our seats and check in, he was told that my seat was on standby. I immediately began to panic. He called the airline to correct the obvious mistake, only to be told that we needed to upgrade to premium seats that cost an added $60. We had no other choice since our original seats had been given away. As we were about to board, the attendant said that our seats were not premium. We ended up in economy as originally assigned, plus we were out an additional $60. We were economy on the way home also. This experience was stressful. I cried, not knowing multiple times if we were going to actually have a seat that had been guaranteed months before! I will not fly this airline again since they were unapologetic and offered nothing to compensate our stress or the extra money that we paid to guarantee a seat."
   We decided to fly from NYC to Miami return with because we had a coupon from an earlier flight we had to cancel. It was just a small amount they gave us back but we thought it's worth it to use it. But after what happened to us on august 2 we will never book with delta again. Our plane was scheduled for 7:02 pm (August 2nd) but then they kept delaying the flight for 3 hours and it kept getting more. Around 8 we saw that other flights would depart earlier then ours (by that time 12:30) so we tried to check if there were other seats available on other planes ! That was the time when we read that the flight got cancelled! We did not get informed by delta nothing! It was not even on the board. So we went to the gate agent to talk with them but the people we talked to didn't understand our situation at all.  We literally had to beg them to help us. My boyfriend called the number they gave us to at least get a coupon or anything that could help us out. But nothing. Even when I asked them for blankets they got mad. Just because we didn't want to accept that they are allowed to treat us like that just because the flight got canceled due bad weather conditions in New York.  Now was the time we gave up hope and decided to stay next to other people sleeping on the Floor waiting for our flight to depart at 11:10 am! Which means we spent more than 16hours at the airport waiting to fly to Atlanta before we finally got the chance to fly back to New York. In Miami we ended up sleeping on a bench. But the benches there are the hardest I ever sat on so it was pretty much impossible to sleep. I swear that was the first and definitely the last time in my life I fly with delta. Unbelievable - I don't know where the humanity went!
"   We flew from Detroit, connected in JFK and final destination Punta Cana, upon arrival at the gate at JFK for the connecting flight via Delta we needed to check in at the gate because boarding passes were not available at departure city. The representatives were great and very professional at the JFK gate B22 -  very patient and professional and got my and my wife to sit together even though the flight was already boarding upon our arrival at the gate."
"   Well this is my first and will be my last time flying American Airlines. I am on the plane as we speak to fly from Toronto to New York LaGuardia. Just got a notification that the plane will not depart until 07.30 as opposed to the 06.30 scheduled time. And to be quite honest, I already wasn’t too pleased by the counter staff at YYZ. They were extremely slow and did not seem very motivated to do their job. Seemed liked they were taking their sweet old time despite the long line up. I’ve never experienced anything so slow when travelling with other airlines. Another gentleman in the line also complained how slow the check in staff were. Now in terms of the flight delay, the pilot stated that there were mechanical issues that needed to be looked at and that the issue was not too serious. Well this obviously makes me nervous. So yeah, I won’t be flying with this airline again. I regret not booking with another airline. Thank goodness I’m not flying AA on my return to YYZ."
"   What a terrible experience on American Airlines. First we have a 4 hour delay in Charleston, because apparently the air conditioning on the plane wasn't working. Then after 2 hours trying to fix it they finally assign another plane to come pick us up in Charleston from Charlotte, NC. This delay causes us to miss our connecting flight and bumps our departure to tomorrow morning (or so we thought). Upon arrival in Charlotte, we find out that our flight to Des Moines was delayed too allowing us to make the flight however it was too late, they sold our seats and we couldn't get on the flight despite being on that flight to begin with. This experience caused me to miss a critical business meeting. I've had nothing but poor experiences with American and it's frustrating to yet again be stuck in a connecting city when it turns out I was on time for the flight anyhow. Thanks for selling the seat that was mine and bumping me to the following day. Come to find out while mingling with a frequent traveler departing Charleston, this is a regular occurrence and this plane frequently has mechanical delays. Take the time to service your equipment. We all have families to get home to, busienss to tend to and we all pay a pretty penny to fly with you. It's clear my money is better spent with a competing airline."
"   Wilmington to Portland (Maine) via La Guardia. Delta seems to be using a bait and switch booking for their flights. I booked this trip for my 90 year old parent and this is how she was treated. First early morning flight was canceled, no warning after she was already at the airport. Delta rebooked for the next morning. The next morning, the rebooked flight was canceled, again she was at the airport before they announced it. Delta rerouted her through multiple airports. It took another 12 hours to get to destination, so lost a full day and a half of vacation, plus the exhaustion and cost of multiple cab trips to and from the airport. Flight home, checked flight and said on time, got to airport - flight was canceled. Delta rebooked through another route. Got to second leg and connecting flight is canceled, so she is sitting at midnight in the airport, waiting again, exhausted. This makes 100% of Delta flights I booked, canceled after getting to the airport. ."
"   Worst customer service I have received. I had a flight from Houston to New York scheduled for today, Monday the 13th, and have been calling to adjust my flight due to the storm since Friday. I was told numerous times that my flight would not be affected by this storm and that in order to change my flight I would need to pay a change fee and the difference. This is completely unacceptable when you have customers being proactive and willing to take earlier flights. I was more than willing to pay the difference in the flight, but no fee waiver was offered. After 4 calls and no help from any customer support representative my flight has now been canceled with no option but to fly out mid-day Wednesday. I am not only losing business but have important job opportunities at risk. "
   Worst flight crew I have ever experienced. It takes a little over an hour of flight time from Arizona to Las Vegas. However it took us over an hour playing musical chairs. For some reason American Airlines could not get it right with the seating chart. They was a mom and daughter who was given completely different airline passes. They boarded the plane and then realized they had the wrong boarding pass. Scary that can happen. None the less we sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half watching the flight crew switch people from seat to seat. 
   Worst travel experience ever. I was traveling for business and it was horrible! Delta staff was nowhere to be found and kept postponing but not canceling my flight for 10 hours! Every Delta employee I dealt with was rude and horrible customer service. I ended up driving from Atlanta to Nashville to try and catch a flight and when I arrived in Atlanta on the 6th at 4am the staff that opened up was incredibly rude. They did not help me rearrange my flight and I went to American Airlines who were helpful and got me home. When I asked Delta for help getting my luggage that was still on my cancelled plane in Atlanta they told me to have American Airlines handle it and it was no longer their responsibility. Great customer service in stressful times creates customers for life - Delta did not earn any customers for life that day. 
"   Zurich to New York JFK. After having a horrible experience departing with Delta back on June 21, 2017, when I returned to JFK, I went through customs and monitored the electronic board for the carousel for baggage. Plane landed at 1:12pm, and at 2:10 the baggage was still not listed. Finally, a number of us started asking various employees who would walk by (almost always not a Delta employee but an airport one), and finally someone said ""The board is not correct. Wait for an announcement."" Eventually we were told the bags had been already out on Carousel 4 (and there were dozens of flights from Delta and other carriers, with hundreds if not thousands of people in the whole area). Disgusting, and incredibly unprofessional. We need in the USA to follow Europe and punish airlines when they screw us over."
   Zurich to New York JFK. The travel went without a problem from the check-in to getting our luggage. I appreciate the level of consistency in the service. All personnel were professional and efficient. Airplane was clean and comfortable. Food and beverages were better than average and more than sufficient. The flight attendants were attentive and the pilots kept us informed. This is the standard I expect from Delta and I am rarely disappointed.
"  
Mexico City to Miami return. AA1031 and AA2416. Both flights on 319, although going out was a better seat (row 12 both ways), return had no legroom whatsoever. To the flights, not charged for bags which was good, no beverage service apart from soft drinks and coffee/tea. Flight was early into Miami but waited 45 mins to get to gate, probably not Americans fault. So late. Return on time but seat room bad, I measured 27 inches, almost impossible for a 6 foot person to sit. Broken bag on return, sorting out now."
"  Absolutely terrible. The airline chose to cancel my flight so they could reroute numerous people and squeeze in their 18 stand by passengers. By doing this they missed my connection flight (even with a 3 hr layover). Upon arrival they scheduled me for a 6pm flight. At 5.45 American Airlines over-rode the airports authority and cancelled our flight, because they wanted more passengers from yet another rerouted plane catching my connection, except after making us wait an extra hour for them to make yet more money, the impending airport had a slight emergency. Had American thought of their passenger who booked months in advance, instead of stand-bys I would have made my trip in the scheduled 4hrs, instead of 18. They refused to re-fund any money. They are a monstrosity of an airline. Every other company made their flights to the same airports on schedule without delay. They claimed inflight wifi, none. It connected but didn't work. They are utterly useless."
"  Absolutely the worst communication from American Airlines. Rude staff, flight from Philadelphia to Seattle got delayed 9 hours with yet again no communication to the guests. I will drive to the rest of my vacations due to the experience we received. This is unacceptable. 2 thumbs down will not recommend this flight to anyone, friends or family"
"  Although I had an American Airlines economy class ticket I was able to select an aisle seat in premium economy which has a 3-3-3 seat layout. The cabin was packed for this flight from London to New York JFK. The plane departed on time but after landing at JFK could not find a gate for over 40 minutes making a mockery of arriving on time. We sat strapped listening to regular updates from the cockpit. The plane was clean; the toilet ran out of tissue paper and a flight attendant had to be told. Soon after takeoff a packet of salted pretzel was given out to the passengers but no drinks leaving my mouth totally dry. Dinner was served soon after with complimentary wine and beer. I chose a pasta dish. The small tray was overloaded with smallish portions from all the food groups - salad, bread, entree, dessert. A hot snack was provided before landing. A large selection of films on the personal IFE but the free headphone provided was so poor in quality that I did not watch or listen to anything as the sound was inaudible over the roar of the engines. Advice: bring your own headphones. The seat was not comfortable at all. The padding and cushioning was rather thin. Worse was the tapping you felt on your back whenever the passenger behind pressed buttons on her IFE to select items for viewing - so thin was the cushioning. Not to mention the lack of any lumbar support. Flight attendants were dutiful and appeared when needed. Overall, another unmemorable flight and totally unimpressed with premium economy."
"  American Airlines check in was very easy and we dropped off our bags at the bag drop. I am Pre Check so security was quick. However the gate area was crowded as the flight from Phoenix to Maui was full so it was hard to hear boarding announcements. Gate agent was pleasant. This is a B757 which means it is old. There is no seat-back IFE just the large monitors placed throughout the cabin. Didn't watch the movie because the sound was not very good. I had my tablet with me so I just watched a couple of downloaded movies on the 6 hour flight. Flight attendants came through the cabin a couple of times with drinks and selling snacks. One of the attendants was cranky but the others were very pleasant. Seat was worn and could use an upgrade. The flight was generally comfortable, we left on time and arrived on time and our bags were out about 20 minutes after we landed. Overall a reasonably good flight. Sometimes I think only people with bad experiences write on these review sites. I have generally been pleased with AA."
  American Airlines flight from Paris was canceled and caused us to experience a 24 hour delay in returning home. Connecting flight from Philadelphia to Denver was then also late by an hour. Ended up spending 23 hours total for this flight from Paris to Denver. After we were notified of the flight was canceled we were only given a phone number to call and had to reschedule our own flights on our own time.
"  American Airlines is by far the I have ever flown. Every single person I came in contact with today for my flight from New York JFK to San Jose was so incredibly rude. First was the man who curbside checked my bags, who talked to me like a complete idiot and then demanded he get a tip before he even began to check my bags. Now I am sitting at my gate where the rude gate attendants asked for people to check bags. As I go up to do so, they rudely asked what I was doing up there then I told them I would like to check a bag to help and (again with all this attitude) asked what seat I was in, I proceeded to tell her, then she barks at me telling me that's not my seat number asks for my last name, and then repeats to raise her voice and tell me that's not my seat number and I need to go sit down. I am fuming right now. I will never ever again fly with American Airlines. I have never been treated this poorly before by so many employees. American Airlines you are a disappointment."
"  American Airlines is honestly one of the worst I've flown. My flight from Columbia to Los Angeles via Dallas was re-routed due to weather, which is fine, however passengers were told they could not leave the plane or else they wouldn't be able to get back on for over 3 hours. Finally we were allowed to fly again and the staff at the gate seemed to not know where to redirect everyone to. They simply didn't plan ahead in any sort of way. When I was able to get my ticket (because the layover plane I previously had a ticket for has left long before), I had to wait 2 more hours because the flight crew had not arrived. The plane was  more and more delayed. Additionally, they gave no sort of accommodation to make up for the massive time gaps. They sat me and my father in the very back with no hope to move up due to their policy of overbooking. Hands down one of the worst airlines out there. They are unorganized and do not care in any way about the customer. They have no communication skills or ability to handle inconvenienced customers. Do not give them your money."
"  As always, am never disappointed at being continually disappointed by American Airlines. They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service. This is not a problem in Europe where you are treated as a human being. Not in America - there, you are just a member of a crowd they have to control."
"  As usual the flight is delayed. It has been four hours so far. The attendents making the announcements scavenged all of the drinks and snacks that were put out for the passengers on the delayed flight. The attendents working the counter also were extremely rude. Some of the passengers were making statements of frustration and the attendents were actually yelling back saying it's not their fault and we all should just quit complaining. Unbelievable! Instead of appreciating our business and apologising for the inconvinience of being delayed (once again, this is my 17th delayed flight in the last few months) the employees got defensive, rude and disruptive. Instead of American being empathetic and compensating passengers with miles, they are rude and unappreciative of their customer base. Not happy with this airline at all."
"  Atlanta to Boise via Salt Lake City. I had an excellent experience with Delta. Easy boarding, staff were helpful, the plane was newly renovated and had one of the best in-flight entertainment systems I had used recently. I really enjoyed my trip, and the Delta staff went above and beyond as far as I was concerned."
"  Atlanta to Rome with Delta. Delayed, bumped, stranded for over 24 hours. I spent over 4 hours on the phone with many agents. Every agent had a different story. Agents in the airport were over worked and unable to assist the large amount of stranded passengers who were all extremely unhappy. Absolutely no assistance was offered. No suggestions as to what do or where to go. I am shocked to be treated this way by Delta."
"  Austin to Tampa via Dallas with American Airlines. On the finale leg of my trip, I was told I needed to check my bag. The gate attendant asked me to test it in the check bag container and after fitting perfectly (I was on two day business trip) she tells me the bag is too large. I was perplexed and handed them my bag. The two passengers in front of me were carrying larger bags and large computer bags. One was a AA employee, of course they were not asked to check their bag. The traveler behind me acknowledged how strange the interaction was and that my bag was clearly not too large. I am livid as I sit and watch bag after bag roll by me. Now as I land at my home destination instead of walking to my car, I will be sitting at the baggage claim. Classy AA. Ask for volunteers, don't force your paying customers into wasting their time."
"  Baltimore to San Diego via Salt Lake City. The worst part of my trip was Delta. Only 2 staff working at the check in counter. There was a huge line of about 45 minutes. We were afraid of missing our plane. The machines they had for the check in procedure were not working. When my turn arrived, I asked for help. The guy told me to go to a different desk to get assistance. When I got there the lady told me I had to wait in another line or if not I could call a number. I dialed the number but they had me 10 minutes waiting. This is not the first time I had problems with them. I do not want to fly with them anymore. Enough is enough."
"  Basic economy tickets with this airline are a scam. We were shocked to find that the bags that we have always used as carry-ons were now charged $25 each. One of our carry ons was accepted for the flight on the trip out but on the way back we were informed at the gate that it would cost $50 for that one. When we got on the plane we noticed that the passenger next to us, flying with the same economy ticket had a carry on under his seat as big as the one that we just had to pay for! We spent $150 extra in baggage fees over the cost of 3 tickets that we will ask for a full refund for. The customer service was the worst that we have experienced in our many flight travels. I've also attached a picture of my medicine pocket of my bag after they handled it. American Airlines...you get a big zero from us!"
"  Buenos Aires to Dallas DFW. First flight for me with the new American Airlines business class flat bed. The thing looks great, lots of storage space, great in flight entertainment system and very decent food. Staff was pleasant. It all went a bit downhill when I tried to sleep. The seat is awkward and asymmetrical when flat. It's very hard and really tight in places. In my case, seat 2D, the left armrest goes down while the right is fixed meaning great shoulder space on your left and squuezed in on the right. There is a big pad on the right side of the seatbelt which gets in your way every time you turn over. Also the tray does not stow away which means you bang your knee every time you turn. When lying on your side one side is quite restricted with regards to bending your knee. Altogether these things seriously impact sleep quality and I wonder if they tested them extensively before introducing them."
"  Chicago to Las Angeles. I'm a pregnant woman traveling with two young children. American Airlines doesn't let families with small children preboard. My youngest fell asleep and I couldn't wake him up so I had to carry him. I always condense carryon bags into a medium sized duffel until I get on the plane and then I take them out once on the plane (I have to bring a nebulizer and emergency bag with Eli pens and allergy medicine for my 3 year old, so it's easier to carry one bag on/ore the plane than multiple small bags) - and they told me I couldn't bring the bag on. I opened the bag and showed them what was in it, and they made me empty the bag (while carrying my sleeping child) and carry on the bags (5 in total) separately."
"  Chicago to Newark. Status quo ""I don't care"" mentality. Nothing new for an US based airline. 10 minutes before boarding people started asking why no one was manning the gate. We finally flagged down an airport rep who went into the computer to tell us the gate changed to the other side of the terminal. Upon checking for boarding, they asked me to check the size of my carry on. It fit, but touched the bar (make no mistake, it fit without pushing). The gate rep told me my bag had to fit without hitting the bar. When, I told him I could remove items to fit in my empty backpack (I'd rather have a light backpack) he slapped a tag and told me I was disrupting boarding (I was on the side of the line and not disrupting the boarding process). Without giving me a chance to unload my carryon a second gate rep came, forcefully took the bag from me and told me, ""you should have listened to the announcement, oh well"". I had just rushed from the other side of the terminal because they forgot to tell people they moved the gate. I dont know why I'm so disappointed in this ""im a flight rep, I make the rules"" mentality from a US based airline. But I am."
"  Cincinnati to Atlanta. I have to say, I haven't flown American Airlines in over 20 years. I found a great ticket price and thought the drive to Cincinatti was worth the hundred dollars I saved however, the experience is one I will never forget. The best I can say is you get what you pay for. Although the inflight service was excellent in the old planes and the flight attendants were warm and grand, the check-in counter people are subpar and definitely not worth the hassle of traveling with the company. I have chosen to just pay the extra dollars, plan ahead of time, and never fly with American Airlines again. The online response team gets back to you quickly with a response. However, the experience of the check-in counter people is amazing to me. They are slow. Which in my observation is not a ticket counter issue but a archaic technology issue. For sure you need to get to the airport 1.5 hours early because simply checking in takes 15-20 minutes per person. I didn't see anyone come to the front and get thru their process swiftly. As management chooses to assist who they want to assist with great customer service, I can truly say you should choose a different company if you want quality."
"  Cincinnati to Omaha via Minneapolis with Delta in First. Newly redone seats. Excellent service. A drink before we even departed. I am mid or top tier on 3 airlines in the US and travel multiples times a week for both business and leisure, so I feel I have a reasonable context from which to rate each experience."
"  Cleveland to Punta Cana via Charlotte. We travelled as a family of 8 for Christmas to Punta Cana. Thanks to AA we missed a whole day in Punta Cana because we missed our flight to Charlotte. We missed the flight because we were waiting for staff to bring a wheelchair for my grandmother who cannot walk through an airport. When we got to the gate, staff said the plane was gone and we were 2 min late. Staff even acknowledged that the time stamp on our luggage was an hour before boarding time. We waited an hour for a wheelchair. We told them we could push the chair but they did not allow it. There was only one lady working the wheelchair area. Of course it being the holidays they could not get us to our destination that day. We flew to Charlotte that day but had to stay the night. They gave us 1 room for my grandmother since she needed the wheelchair, but we had to pay for additional rooms. I guess AA thought we could have left an old lady and got on a flight without her. We are a family! We come together and leave together! The luggage was a whole other situation. We had the AA agent check all of our luggage tickets. She ensured us that once we missed the flight our luggage did not go either. Well, my luggage was in Punta Cana without me. Once we made it to Punta Cana only 1 family member's luggage came on the belt! Total disaster and staff had no idea where it was. Everyone elses luggage eventually came and all was good. I am very disappointed in AA, we even tried to get refunds and just cancel the trip. They would not give refunds because they said it was our fault that we missed the original flight. We had travel insurance. This is the short version of what happened. The misinformation from AA agents in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Punta Cana is another story. Never again. Oh no wifi on the plane, but the flight attendants were nice. On the way home, I did have to listen to the flight attendants entire personal conversations because I was sitting in the very last row. That was annoying because I wanted to sleep."
"  Dallas to Kansas City. This has been a terrible experience. I have been sitting on this plane in Dallas for 45 minutes. We have not moved. As a passenger, we are sitting here like a group of prisoners. Sun is shining, no excuses for this type of treatment. I will arrive more than an hour late, so my vacation is already off on the wrong foot. I planned everything perfect for my trip involving multiple families, but made one mistake. Relying on American Airlines to actually be effecient and get me to Kansas City on time. Now I have 15 people waiting at KC airport as we sit on a plane in TX."
"  Dallas to Louisville via Detroit with Delta. Flight was delayed for 6 hours for mechanical reasons. We were told before we left that there would be a hotel provided on several occasions. Once we arrived, we were told that there would be no hotel, but we were free to wait for the next 10 hours for our flight, but they did not know where our gate was."
"  Dallas to Toronto. American Airlines is really struggling to deliver any form of consistent service. This was another example of a failure to deliver acceptable levels of customer service. The gate staff and cabin crew were disinterested in their job. Customers were really a distraction. Telephoning their call centre is an exercise in patience - I waited for just shy of an hour to speak to someone. When I did they were unable or unwilling to provide the assistance I required. The only good thing I could say about the flight was that my bag arrived. Sadly, American Airlines seems to be struggling on just so many fronts."
"  Delta continues to employ overbooking. As I was flying out of New York to Austin, I was preparing to board when I watched the harried gate agent begin the begging process for anyone willing to give up their seat on the early flight for a guaranteed seat 10 hours later. We were told after the flight had left that we would receive an email explaining the process for receiving our compensation in ""about 30 minutes."" That was Friday - today is Monday - no email. I would think Delta would learn that bad press is to be avoided - but maybe you are functioning on the premise that any press is good press."
  Delta flight from West Palm beach to La Guardia was delayed since 1 PM. Now they announced that we might take off at 7 PM. If you do the math that's 6 hours of wasted personal time and unnecessary inconvenience. I promised myself to never fly with Delta ever again! Worst experience with this unprofessional and careless company.
"  Delta have adopted Spirit Airlines as their business model but they stand behind having room and space for people to operate in, which is false. The service workers are as good as they can be but the policy makers have put all these folks in a bad spot cramming tons of people in tight spaces. Boarding and exiting the plane is unorganized and difficult. Delta are a bad choice if your flight is over 90 minutes long. Leg room is non-existent, even in most of their preferred seating. Long lines in just two bathrooms areas from NYC to San Francisco. Will not be flying Delta anymore."
"  Detroit to Miami. Terrible, terrible experience. The airline was delayed for 3 hours which would have been okay, if it wasn't for the rest of the ride. Some of the inflight entertainment monitors were broken, mine included. No wifi was available at all. It was easily 100 degrees with the air conditioning. The descent gave me airsickness for the first time in my life and it was the worst landing I've felt yet. Then we waited 20 minutes sweltering, waiting to taxi to the gate. Finally I emerge and our bags are not there because of the ""volume of luggage"" on the flight. So we have to wait. The service was polite but the whole staff clearly didn't care about the passengers experience, opinion, nor did they give us anything to compensate for the misery. Don't fly American, I never will again"
"  Don't fly American Airlines if you can avoid it, their customer service and communication terrible. For that reason I had not flown AA for years, however I decided to use them this time (Atlanta to Los Angeles via Dallas) and nothing has changed. Don't say I didn't warn you. Best airline is Southwest for domestic flights. They are efficient, their customer service is excellent and they don't charge change fees and bags fly free. I hate to be parked in a plane on runaway for an hour twice in one day."
"  Everything is in the fine print when you book a ticket with American. We bought three tickets from Boston to Chicago and paid for three, yet they gave one of the seats away. The answer if you look at the fine print, you agreed to the terms. That's way I try to fly SW, Jetblue and others."
"  First flight of the morning the plane breaks. My husband and I wait 2 hrs trying to reroute our flight from Charleston to Charlotte. American had another plane fly in to replace broken plane. So our 6:15 departure is now 12:15 then 1:00 then 1:40. We did not pay extra to upgrade our seats so it seems that they will split up seats bought together so you cannot sit next to your spouse apparently that is extra? When our plane arrived we asked if we could change our seat assignment and were told no. Upon boarding we found the plane was half full and those of us who did not pay their extra fees sat in the back rows all split up from our spouses. I realize this is a business and I chose to fly no frills. However, when the company is at fault and they could accommodate a seat change on a delayed flight and place people toward the front to catch their connections why would they not do so? We missed 2 connecting flights because of their poor planning. We have not flown American in years and maybe that was the problem. We will not fly them again. Go Southwest!"
"  First of all, I would never have flown American Airlines had I had another choice. We fly Alaska Airlines 95% of the time as we have found their customer service superb and we live in the West Coast so it’s most convenient. At this time, however, there is no flight from Philly to Pitt on AK airlines so we booked a second itinerary on American. When we had originally checked in, they would not link our two separate itineraries even though Alaska Airlines did flying down. So we will have to get our bags from baggage claim and drop them, then go through the whole process of checking in our bags/security before our next leg of our long journey home. Apparently, American is undergoing ""budget cuts"" (literally, one of the gate attendants said this) and when you buy a ticket it’s not the same as buying a seat. So you have to pay extra to verify that you A) get a seat and B) get to sit with your party on the plane. Alaska Airlines does not ever make us do this. Again, the woman at the gate had deplorable customer service skills, very rude and curt. Not sympathetic or apologetic at all. She said to ""calm down"" even though I was obviously less than pleased but not acting out in any way. We almost weren’t going to get on our flight because they overbooked — are you surprised? Luckily, two passengers were willing to take a later flight for incentive allowing us to get on the plane. It seems that Americans Airlines is clearly struggling financially and in their professional development of staff. They might as well just close up shop because no one recommends flying on their airline anyway. If I pay $600 RT for a ticket from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh I expect to have a seat and be greeted with a smile. That should not be so much to ask. I have heard Alaska Airlines is adding a leg from Seattle to Pitt. I’ll be glad and happy to pay them for a seat on that flight in the future."
"  Flew Albuquerque to Chicago. Toilets out-of-service on aircraft. Discovered also that the lamps above my row and the electricity were out. I notified the steward and asked to be reseated. He refused saying that there were no seats. I told him I could see seats right in front of me. He told me that you have to pay for those seats. I told him that I was Platinum Elite and am entitled to complimentary Main Cabin Extra seats. Rather than handling the situation before him diplomatically and with grace toward a valued traveler, he replied, ""well, if you really are Platinum Elite then you know you cannot change seats onboard."" The abrasiveness and discourtesy was so breathtaking I didn't pursue it further. When dealing with primitive people, it is best not to anger them. There is a new something special in the air with American Airlines: If their cabin crew cannot get themselves out of a jam with a passenger in a bad situation they themselves have created and aggravated, then they try to have you arrested when you land."
"  Flew American Airlines from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Philadelphia. Staff at the airport were really friendly and helpful but as soon we got on the first flight the staff were rude. We could here them swearing and shouting to each other at the back of the plane. We had a long flight (6hrs) to Philadelphia and were only offered one drink and a cookie because no one had checked the catering before take off so there was no food on board. There was also no entertainment on board. Before taking our second flight we asked and checked if there was entertainment so we could prepare ourselves and buy magazine/books etc. The lady told us that each seat had a tablet style screen. When got on board there were only small central screens in the aisles and the headphone jacks gave so much feedback it was unbearable to listen to. We unfortunately had bad snow and wind, combined with a technical fault we were delayed by 3 hours. Communication was terrible during this time and during bad turbulence."
"  Flew American Airlines from Miami to Charlotte. Flight was late 30 minutes because of flight crew mix up and now we have been waiting over an hour for our bags at baggage claim. Its now 1.20am, no announcements, just people asleep that don't care about the customers waiting. 3 other flights have come and gone. Where is the customer service?"
"  Flew American Airlines from Tulsa to Baltimore. Late flights and terrible baggage handling, avoid this airline at all costs. Baggage gets left at origin and I am not informed until I reach my destination. I have none of my essentials before a big interview and this airline was in no hurry to deliver my luggage to me even after it arrived at baggage claim the next day."
"  Flew Austin to Washington via Charlotte on American Airlines. Main Cabin Extra on an A321 to CLT. Leg room was fine as was seat comfort. Flight attendants were nice and served a couple rounds of drinks and light snacks. On time dep and arrival in CLT. Newer A319 to DCA in First. Only 8 seats up front made for a cozy cabin and actually very personalized service for a short 58 min flight. Pre-departure beverage, some decent red wine, followed by more beverages and a snack basket once airborne. A good trip, on time and reasonably comfortable. Only negatives, AA's gates are a mess. Large crowds, everyone standing, no resemblance of any order. Delta starts boarding early, which helps and United uses lanes which I really like. AA executives needs to spend some time in the terminal. Boarding is chaotic at best and I'm Exec Plat.on AA."
  Flew Charlotte - Frankfurt and return at the beginning of December. We opted to use frequent flyer miles so this was a good value in that respect. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early and the pilots did a good job of alerting us to potential turbulence on the route. The seat back trays were dirty and flight attendants had nothing to clean them with but gave us napkins so we could wipe them ourselves. Seats were okay but no longer have adjustable headrests so not as comfortable as in the past. Cabin crew was what seems to be a typical mix on the legacy carriers - some were pleasant but some were decidedly cranky. Food service was minimal with small portions. Not a big deal for me as I don't tend to eat much on flights but big eaters would definitely be disappointed. Only one beverage service with the meal but drinks (water and juice) were set up in the rear galley so passengers could help themselves. IFE was disappointing. There appeared to be a decent number of options but the touchscreen was very unresponsive and required a lot of effort to move through the menu so I only watched movies and shows from the first page or so. The overall experience was okay and I appreciate the direct flight from North Carolina to Germany but American would not be my first choice for long haul economy as other airlines flying US to Frankfort seem to offer a nice experience.
"  Flew to Boston from DFW and back on a nice TWA retro jet in first class. The service was impeccable; great food and drink, good movie library in personal AVOD. Very friendly staff, comfortable seats. Could not ask for a better flight; in my many years of travel this one is definitely at the top. It is nice to see that the golden standard of flying is coming back. Will definitely keep flying American."
"  Flights seem to always be delayed and by at least one, if not several hours. If this is going to consistently happen, I don't understand why Delta couldn't just plan for delays better because this is a waste of everyone's time. Even though everything else is sufficient, the lack of punctuality is very inconvenient."
"  Flying on Delta today has been one of the worst experiences I've had flying with any airline. My original departure for return started in Brunswick followed by a horrendous stop in Atlanta. Upon arrival at approx 230 pm I was directed to a boarding gate in terminal A gate 17. A short hour later they changed the gate to terminal A gate 31. A short hour later the flight was changed to terminal B gate 33. Keep in mind at no time was an announcement ever made for gate change, the unmanned tv screen just miraculously changed without notice. Just when we thought it was over and by we I mean the several passengers in wheelchairs, and those needing assistance to board, we're notified that 2 mins prior to boarding time they had changed gates again. This time we would have to run essentially to terminal E gate 35. Some arrived approx 10 mins after scheduled boarding including myself to be told that the flight will mow be pushed back because it flew in from Colombia and needed to be cleaned. I approached the gate representative and notified him that my next leg from Seattle was international and that the new arrival time only allows a 30 minute window between arrival time and actual departure of my next leg international to Victoria, Canada. The response I got was priceless and he typed my name into the computer to verify and suddenly looked up with a smile as he said I guess you should run when you get there! While I wanted to laugh I also realized it's probably not a good time as a rep to be making jokes to passengers who have been re-gated 4 times and may or may not make it home to their family on time or even the same day. Professionalism and some punctuality is important if you wish for customers to return and in this case as I heard from the crowd numerous times Delta lost many return customers to include myself."
  For everyone who wants to check a bag with American (usually $25) better do it before you get to the gate as the prices doubles as you rush to your flight. Checked one small carry on at the gate for $50. Seriously? Current status: flown 24 times with American in 2017 and was looking forward to getting gold! Not anymore!
"  Fort Lauderdale to Cincinatti with Delta. We were coming home after a cruise and our original flights were FLL to ATL to CVG. We were able to come to the airport earlier than we thought and went to check in at 12:05 for a 3pm flight. However, the lady at the counter said if we want to we could go in a direct flight to CVG that leaves at 12:30pm. We said sure and she printed new tickets for all 5 of us direct to CVG from FLL. We barely made it to the gate after going through TSA etc. We arrived in CVG before 3pm (even earlier than we were supposed to leave from FLL). So, I want to commend the quick thinking of the staff who was at the check-in counter at FLL. Also, during the flight to CVG we were given fruits and drinks, not once but twice. Much better service than even west to east coast flight on any domestic airline (economy)."
"  From Washington to Chattanooga all the staff except one attendant on the flight was rude. Once there we had three hour delay that no one seemed to know why. We did however get to stand on a bus for 45 minutes while they lied about not having a flight crew, it ended up being the staff that was onboard while we stood on the bus. No more AA flying for me."
"  Greenville to New York. Sat on the tarmac for at least half hour. Then we pull up to gate and everyone is on lunch duty. This past summer I went to Madrid on American, 2.5 hour delay. I finally get off the plane and I run to a different terminal in hopes of catching a earlier flight to NYC. I was supposed to fly into JFK at 10pm on a Sunday. I found two flights to LGA that arrived around 8pm. They say I have to pay a $230 to switch airports or buy new ticket for $150 plus $30 tax. On the flight to Charlotte from JFK I couldn’t even watch TV cause headphone jack was broken."
"  Honolulu to Los Angeles with Delta in the Premium cabin. Of the old legacy carriers only Delta provides real service. On this internationally configured aircraft I was lucky to have private comfortable space and a lie flat seat. The meal was fine, the entertainment very good and the staff on the ground and in the air were amazing. Friendly, efficient and caring in the old school way. Miles ahead of UA and AA on the same and any route."
"  Honolulu to Los Angeles with Delta. The flight was more then fine but what I am happy to say is the quality with which they handled a 12 hour delay due to a sick pilot which was no ones fault. Every passenger was efficiently issued vouchers for a room at a five star hotel, a round trip taxi and meal vouchers. In addition Medallion members received 10,000 extra miles. Everyone was gracious, kind and efficient. Kudos to Delta Honolulu for their actions."
"  I am a Delta Diamond Million Miler, and flew from Frankfurt to New York JFK. I realize Delta has some senior crews but the Business Class cabin crew on DL400/28Jul was beyond senior. I overhead a conversation with one stating she had been flying for 44 years, the other responded that she had ""over 50"" years on the job. Cabin service was atrocious - rude, uncaring, thrown at passengers with an angry glare and snatched away. When the purser was asked about a menu item she responded with, ""how would I know? I haven't looked."" Beverage refills were non-existent - even when I asked for another glass of water the attendant working my side neither acknowledged my request nor made any effort to fulfill it. A frustrated passenger finally asked the 50+ year attendant if she could hear him as she kept ignoring him and she responded loudly, saying just because she's German doesn't mean she doesn't speak English. There was no warmth or welcoming feeling on board - more of a challenging, ""us versus them"" sensation. Food was good, flight was on time - but staff service unacceptable."
  I booked my flight home for the holidays from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via New York JFK in March 2016 with my girlfriend. I specifically avoided exit and back rows because it's a 6+hour flight and I want to recline my seat. Delta changed my flight 5 times and changed our seats. I was fine with the seat change because we were next to each other until I show up and realize it's on the back row. Completely uncomfortable. I will avoid flying Delta again.
  I bought 2 tickets to fly with my boyfriend. Both to and from our destination our seats were split up. I called customer service and they told me it's gate seating and 99.9% of the time you get to sit together. Clearly not that percentage when it happened both flights. What is the point of buying tickets together when they don't even seat you together. I will never recommend nor fly American again.
"  I bought my daughter and grandson a ticket to come and see me in Chattanooga. Their flight back (today) was supposed to leave at 5.45pm, it's 7.15pm right now and they are still sitting on the plane because it won't start! She has a 5 month old with her, and no information is being given to the passengers. I've flown this airline myself in December. I can honestly say that I would never book with American Airlines again. I will start flying with Delta again. They are telling my daughter that she probably has to rebook her connecting flight, this airline continues to disappoint."
"  I can't express how wonderfully Delta has treated me and my family during this time of need. My father passed away suddenly and I needed a bereavement rate. They provided it with ease, saving my two sons $600 each over the price of another carrier. On the plane, they offered a selection of snacks including Kind bars which were a great alternative to pretzels. I was treated well by every member staff. I can't say enough about how great Delta is. When I fly in the future my choice will be Delta."
"  I do not recommend American Airlines. I had the worst experinec flying from LA to Dulles Washington. At the airport in LA they made my life miserable because I had my laptop along with my purse and back pack as a carry on. They told me that laptop is considered an additional bag and I have to shove it in my backpack to give the illusion that I am carrying 2 bags. On top of everything returning from Philadelphia I had a carry on bag full of glass souvenirs. They wanted me to check in the bag due to no overhead space. I had to empty my carry on to remove all the glass items for me to carry them on to the plane. Lord be hold, I walk on to the plane and there is plenty of room above. I have traveled a lot and never encountered such an unorganized company. I will never recommend or fly with this airline ever again."
"  I experience significant delays on most of my trips with American Airlines, and as a result only fly on it on the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh route where it has a monopoly or if its ticket price is significantly cheaper than the alternatives. Most recently, this airline had a 3-hour delay on the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh route, on which it charges fares comparable to many intercontinental routes, with no concessions and only a curt verbal apology. The airplane itself was in bad condition, with grating squeaking in many of the armrests. I would not fly it on any routes where there is a choice."
"  I flew from Portland to Phoenix and then from Phoenix to Pittsburgh in a 20 hour period. In those 20 hours American Airlines delayed me two times making me wait in the airport for a total of 6 hours, and lost my checked bag making me wait another hour. I hardly get time off of work and American Airlines essentially made me spend one of my precious PTO days waiting in an airport. I always say I won’t fly this airline again as this is not the first time something like this has happened. This time I truly will never fly them again. If I could give them less then 1/10 I would. Figure it out American Airlines."
  I flew from Sioux Falls to Minneapolis with connection to Newark. There was 1 hour delay at FSD due to air traffic according to the pilot and I arrived at MSP too late for my connection. Delta rescheduled me for next day flight but my trip was already ruined due to the delay. Delta stated in MSP that the delay was due to weather which was not true so that they do not have to refund me. Another Delta passenger had the same experience as me who was from a different city. They made me pay for the hotel overnight. I also cancelled the whole trip but they could not tell me even approximate of how much credit I received for cacelling rest of the trip. Delta basically lied about why there was a delay and cannot provide even basic customer service. I will avoid this airline.
"  I flew from Washington to Phoenix via Dallas in first class just after Christmas. After reading some of these reviews I was not expecting much, but I thought everything was fine. Even though the MD-80 is an older aircraft, the seats were still comfortable. The flight left on time and the flight attendants were very nice. They allow you to pre-order your meal online with at least 24 hours advance notice. I ordered the lasagna, which came with a salad and warm rolls from a breadbasket. Warm cookies were served afterwards. Then on the Dallas to Phoenix flight we were given a snack; I chose the hummus with crackers. Again, the flight attendants were very nice. Perhaps others have had other experiences, but I honestly can't fault them for anything and I would fly them again on first class."
  I had a connecting flight to DC. Plane was to arrive in plenty of time to connect. Flight to D.C. overbooked (I confirmed with customer service). Plane held in Tallahassee. Pilot said we will just sit here for a while. Arrived at gate at exact boarding time ended. Plane left 5 minutes early. Cost me an appointment with my congressman and senator. Lesson is to allow at least one hour between connecting flight to important destinations and connecting customers can be held hostage.
"  I had a family emergency and had to cancel my Washington to Akron via Detroit flight 18 hours prior to take off. I notified Delta customer service of my situation and with no questions asked, they cancelled my flight and awarded me with a full credit. I'm very pleased with Delta and their graciousness towards myself. They gave me one less thing to worry about. I definitely will go out of my way to fly only Delta in the future."
"  I have never had a good experience with American Airlines. And I just now had another bad one where I wasted an hour and a half on the phone trying to get a flight reserved. American Airlines is almost always late in my experience and their lateness last July caused us to miss our connecting flight. Just because it was with another airline, also terrible, I had to pay full, walk-in price for tickets because of American Airlines inability to be on time. I complained and got a ridiculous $25 voucher which I can't even use except in the U.S. Why all this penny-pinching when airlines are profiting off us like crazy? And we all know it. The flights are hot and crowded. It's a miserable experience."
"  I just returned form the trip that I took from Saint Louis to Washington Reagan. American Airlines totally ruined the trip. Not only did we not get to DC in time to do anything, the same thing happened on the return flight home. Our flight was delayed and we did not get home until after midnight. We sat at both airports watching American Airlines flights being delayed and canceled. We were not the only ones. I will never fly AA again. Basically anyone was fortunate if they left on time. I was totally shocked. I really almost feel sorry for the gate personnel. It is no wonder that were telling people that “It is just your tough luck”, they have to be ashamed and sick of it themselves. While waiting in St. Louis, the gate personnel did not want to give out meal vouchers. One lady apparently aware that after such a wait that we were entitled to meal vouchers got up and asked for the meal voucher, the gate personnel whispered, “If I give you one I have to give everyone one.” Let me tell you about a similar experience I had with Southwest Airlines recently. The same delay happened and after a couple of hours the gate personnel started playing a game with everyone at the gate. They started giving mileage vouchers for the delay. I have flown for years and I have never had such incompetent, terrible service. The only way I will ever fly AA again would be that it is my only option and I have to use AA."
"  I missed my connecting flight with Delta due to an electrical storm. Although that is not the airline's fault, the fact that I had less than 5 minutes to get to my other plane and the crew did not ask for people who were not connecting to wait to disembark so those of us that needed to run could make our connections. Atlanta is a big airport and of course the connecting plane was on the opposite side of the terminal. Once making it to the connecting gate, the customer service representative chuckled when she told the 4 people, that needed that plane, ""yes, that's your plane pulling away"". I slept in the terminal because the next available flight was 9 hours later. Gate changed at least 3 times. I am writing this as I sit on the plane they rebooked me on, supposedly getting ready to go, but actually has sat at the gate with all passengers for over an hour because the underground fuel tanks aren't working. Needless to say, my connecting flight has now been delayed by 1.5 hours. My main complaints are that the desk people are rude and the communication is poor. The airport is dirty."
"  I purchased a $5,000 business class ticket and was later advised by email that AA lost the services of its food service company. I asked for a refund to buy a ticket on another airline that offered a business class service, but was told I had a write a letter to request a refund. I was served chips, grapes and pizza pops on the 15 hour flight. I was offered a $200 refund, but was told I had to wait in line after the 15 hour flight to get the coupon. The worst part of this experience was that I checked on the AA website and they were selling the same flights that week, with no mention of the catering issues. I would recommend anyone flying on AA through LAX should find another airline!"
  I purchased a round trip Charlotte to Harrisburg and going and coming flights were delayed. Right now I'm sitting in the airplane back in Charlotte because they can't find a gate. We have been here for 20 minutes now. Do not fly American Airlines if you can help it. Update I have now been in here waiting for 35 Minutes.
"  I took 2 trips this month with my son and American are the worst airline to travel with kids. No respect for Moms with kids. My Flight was canceled from Grand Cayman to Charlotte. I was standing for 1 hour and half in line my baby is crying no one try to help you first. Moms with kids don't board first just the worse experience with this airline. On my flight from Dallas to Minneapolis the flight attendant said passed by and said ""oh your kid made a mess"" he was eating crackers what do u expect from a 2 year old?"
"  I took American Airlines AA109 flight LHR-LAX (Economy) just over a month ago. And let me tell you, it was nice: you left the plane with a great feeling rather than a standard one! While it is hard to describe what exactly went so well, I will try - the crew: this was probably most important. The crew was very nice and helpful throughout the flight. They brought more water all the time (very important on planes) and was just always there when you needed something. They would also take your trash with them, even when they were just passing by. Some were a little bit stressed toward the end of the flight but that was ok since they were working hard. This was especially obvious after I took my flight back with Iberia from MIA-MAD where it took them a full 2.5 hrs after takeoff to serve drinks for the first time. It was an overnight flight and people wanted to use the time to sleep. I snagged a main cabin extra seat for free using my status, so I had additional legroom, that was great! Also the lavatories were still very clean, even after 11.5 hrs of flight. As we all know, economy class food isn’t especially known for its quality. What we had though, was very good for economy. It was fried chicken in Chinese sweet sauce or something with rice. The sides were fine, as was the breakfast. I was really impressed. (Dinner was also tasty on Iberia but the breakfast was just average I’d say). In the rear part of the plane, the crew had two nice sets of snacks and soft drinks for everyone to have as much as they’d like. They also constantly refilled everything and you could ever ask them for other things they didn’t put out there. Also, they would talk to passengers, it was like a place to socialize! Really amazing for economy. The only thing I didn’t enjoy so much was the temperature. While it was ok for lots of people, I often think it’s a lil bit cold on the planes but the crew assured me, they would turn the heating up a bit for me. Didn’t help so much after all, but that’s ok. As you can see, American Airlines is not as bad as lots of people say. Personally, I enjoyed my time on the plane!"
  I was on an American Airlines flight from Newark to Houston via Dallas. The flight was delayed for 2.5 hours for an unknown reason. We finally get onto the plane and the seats are compact. We landed Dallas for our connecting flight and rush to the gate to Houston and we find out the gate is closed. The flight didn't even leave yet but they woundnt let us on. The next flight was the next day in the evening. We had to spend extra money on a motel. I will never fly with American Airlines again.
"  I was scheduled to fly out on American Airlines on 4/17/2017 at 11:00 am from St. Louis to Washington Reagan. I arrived plenty early (9:00 am). Everything went smooth until I reached the gate to depart. I am now still sitting here waiting for a plane to arrive. It's 2:15 pm. When inquired upon where the plane was at, I was told two different stories - the plane was on its way or another plane was in the hanger and would be coming. None of the employees seem to care that appointments are being missed. No one seems to know anything. I know one thing for sure - I will never fly this airline again."
"  I was traveling to Lynchburg, VA for a medical school open house and had many troubles with American Airline. My luggage was delayed, almost missed my connection flight because they had the wrong gate number on the boarding pass and finally my flight was delayed for entire day. Their customer service is terrible, I was not able to get anywhere with them. As a last ditch effort I tried emailing the CEO, and few other big shots of the company to my surprise they actually read their emails and my issues were resolved within the hour of the email. Overall my experience with the airline started off horrible but at the end they took care of me. I was reimbursed for travel expenses additionally given a eVoucher for a new ticket and during my delay they put me in a nice hotel. If you can reach the right people for help American Airline will take care of you! I will definitely fly with them again just not check-in any luggage."
"  I work in TX and work in NV, so I fly frequently Dallas DFW to Las Vegas, once every 2 weeks, and always by American Airlines because of the convenience (non-stop flight). AA is a Dallas Fort Worth based company. I am now a member of AA and a platinum Mastercard holder. I flew this morning (flight 542) in a seat that I upgraded paying $64. For this sum of money, I got to sit in 5C, a seat with a malfunctioning belt that refused to lock, I also got boarding privilege of Group 5 and my 2 bags were not the last to come out but close to last. It is an absolute disgrace that AA charges us $64 for an upgrade, for what? Did I mention the gate changes, on Sunday. I checked my gate online, and, I learnt that it was C10. The next day I got a boarding pass that said C7; while seated close to C7 we were told that it would be C8. Well we flew out of C24, I am glad I was paying attention, knowing that with this team anything was possible. AA is a very poorly run organization by people who are beyond caring. I think there were 2 seats in row 5 that had belts malfunctioning, 5C and 5E. Both the airline and DFW airport need a complete overhaul. Yes, everything in TX is big, but who gives a damn about dimensions, we want quality, we want efficiency."
"  I would like to write about my disappointment with American Airlines service this morning. We are a family of three including 13-year-old child booked a flight from Providence to Washington DC at 6:15 AM. At boarding time, American Airlines staff started offering $500 bonus for volunteers to give up their seats. We did not volunteer, but we were told that we had no seats on the flight. We were rescheduled for a much later flight in the afternoon and offered only $200 bonus. I will never fly American Airlines again."
"  If you are in trouble, you can count on American Airlines. I lost my passport before my flight from Las Vegas to Toronto and you should see all they did for me. More than I could ask. They found me a solution, reorganize everything and didn't charge a cent for it. All the staff were great."
  Indianapolis to Philadelphia via Atlanta with Delta for business and here are my observations. Aircraft retrofitted and new and clean. Crew were friendly and gave good eye contact. Ground crew were also so kind and went out of their way to help us. All flights were on time - I was very impressed with Delta.
  Jacksonville to Charlotte. Poor service both ways. Why use mobile ticket when one has to go back to counter after waiting cause there is issue with ticket? What is the purpose of pre check if line not open? Flight attendants subpar. Multiple flight delays on way to this destination with aa personnel ever changing excuses. Uninformed reps in airport telling clients the can stay in airport then being run off by security telling us we have to leave terminal. Supposed to be best airline of 2017 but definitely not. Worst than Spirit and United combined.
"  Las Vegas to Boston via Charlotte. Our flight on Spirit was cancelled. We were booked onto American Airlines (same airline in which we flew in on). The staff were amazing and even made sure my very tall husband had a seat he fit in (we were not charged for upgrade on the way home), they insured we sat together. We had a medical issue with a passenger. The staff handled it wonderfully and professionally. I was amazed by thier calmness! While it wasn't straight through, our layover in Charlotte was awesome. Excellent service."
"  Las Vegas to Myrtle Beach with American Airlines. I'm very dissatisfied with the wait for boarding and when finally on the plane, the seats are crammed in like a sardine can. It's very disappointing that AA over charges for flights then put us on dated aircraft. It's impossible to be comfortable sitting on top of one another. AA is going up there with Spirit and Frontier of the airlines I won't fly with any longer."
  Long Beach to Alexandria via Dallas with American Airlines. Horrible experience. Arrived in Dallas at 2PM plane was supposed to leave at 4PM. Received multiple text messages indicating my plane will leave at 5:37 then 6PM then 6:37 and then 7:20 and then 8:20. When airline rep was confronted about the delay I was told they were waiting for staff. At 7ish we were advised plane was ready. Such a horrible experience I have lost so much money waiting around for this airline to handle business.
"  Los Angeles to Atlanta with American Airlines. Well, after an hour delay to board and mediocre at best flight attendant service, we've now been sitting on the plane for 2 hours after having already landed because the disorganization of this company to move aircrafts from the terminals. Meanwhile, no food or even water has been offered while sitting here, which at this point and after a 5 hour flight, I would categorize as basic human goodness, let alone customer service. This is without a doubt the last time I will ever fly American Airlines."
"  Los Angeles to Kona with Delta. This was a good flight with one bizarre and inappropriate exception. First, the positive. Great friendly efficient staff on the ground and inflight. The overhead bins are the largest i've ever seen and for the first time ever in Hawaii the priority tagged luggage arrived first and in record time. In addition, the Kona ground staff were at luggage claim offering bottled water. Here's the bizarre twist. The first class meal offered was a cold processed sandwich with 3 slices of apple and a Saran wrapped cookie. The wonderful cabin crew was embarrassed and had no idea or explanation. I have flown this flight at least 20 times in the last few years and a hot meal was always offered. This is a 5 hour flight with a 5pm departure in a first class cabin. In addition for a while now Delta has been the only carrier offering wi-Fi between the mainland and Hawaii. Although the aircraft was equipped the service was not available. Again, the flight attendants were as mystified as myself. I thought the new aircraft was an upgrade from the 757?"
"  Los Angeles to Tucson with Delta. Awesome! We missed our 11:55am flight. Delta rebooked 3 of us on the 5pm flight with 1 more in our party on that flight provisionally. The other 2 in our party booked on the 8:30pm flight, with the option of asking for standby on the 5pm flight. We all got on the 5 pm flight, sitting in the last 2 rows, perfect for traveling with 2 kids, Not only that, but the flight attendant was absolutely super - got wings for the 3 year old and got him a visit to the cockpit when we landed. Kudos Delta."
"  Me and my family managed to grab a bargain with American Airlines on our most recent vacation from Glasgow to Orlando via Philadelphia. The price was more than 70% cheaper than any other airline operating the route, however if I knew the misery we would have to endure then I definitely wouldn't have flown with AA. The first problem arose at check in (GLA-PHL) where we were allocated new seats from the ones we had previously purchased resulting in my family being split up throughout the aircraft. We complained and was given new seats nearby each other but still not the ones we had paid £200 for previously, which American Airlines are still refusing to issue a refund. Next when we arrived at the gate we were informed that the flight was delayed but that it wouldn't be long and they were going to commence boarding - not long turned into sitting on the aircraft for almost 2 hours. The aircraft was old, in need of refurbishing, extremely cramped and didn't have personal inflight entertainment which American Airlines didn't tell us while booking. The aircraft did have an overhead screen which played one movie during the 7hrs 45min flight to Philadelphia, however me, and many other people sitting around us thought it was unsuitable for children to view. The staff were rude, never came across people with such bad manners, talked inappropriately about passengers onboard the aircraft (which we have complained about) and couldn't be bothered doing their job but instead stand at the back of the aircraft talking. The food was poor quality, even for airplane food, and was thrown down in front of us. The aircraft landed just over 2 hours late making it tight for our connection to Orlando. Once on the connecting flight we were told that our bags had missed the connection and would be sent on the next flight out, not the best news for the start of you're holiday. We had a mad dash to the flight, just making it by minutes to spare, and once we sat down were told that the flight was delayed due to technical problems resulting in another 2 hour delay. The staff were slightly friendlier on the connection to Orlando and we eventually landed about 5 hours late (thunderstorms near Orlando delayed us). We got off the aircraft rather quickly and proceeded to baggage information for American Airlines which told us that our bags wouldn't be arriving until the next afternoon, we were offered several thousand air miles as compensation which we rejected as we had already decided we will never touch American Airlines again. Our bags eventually arrived the next evening but an extremely poor service and lack of information from American Airlines. I definitely do not recommend."
"  Miami to Toronto with American Airlines. What a terrible experience - all flights on my trip were delayed due to ""maintenenace issues"" which happens all the time with AA because they don't invest and maintain their planes as preventative and only do this when something is wrong causing constant delays. Using the excuse about everyone's safety is laughable. They don't communicate to customers how long the delay will be like other airlines. The company is more interested in paying their shareholders and executives and put customer last. Well this is the very last time I fly American Airlines. I'm done."
"  Minneapolis to Phoenix with Delta. I checked in with the seat I had chosen online, however, when going past the ticketing agent to board the plane, she handed me a new seat assignment. This was a middle seat 12 rows back from my chosen seat. If somebody had needed my seat to be close to family would have been happy to switch, however was very unimpressed that they had not bothered to ask or tell me ahead of time. Luckily I was traveling alone this flight. Will definitely consider other airlines in the future."
"  Montréal to Managua via Miami. I booked a return ticket online. The flight had a 24hr layover in Miami. I figured that my checked in luggage (which I paid 25$cad) would stay at the airport while I go sleep at a hotel near by. I still went to check at the baggage claim if it was there. So I saw my luggage, picked it up and went to the American Airline desk next to the baggage claim. The girl looked annoyed that I asked her why I got my luggage back if I’m flying again with them the next day. I said that I booked only 1 ticket and didn’t want to carry my luggage back and forth and especially not pay to check it in again. She replied rudely that it wasn’t her problem. I questioned her about what to do to solve my situation. She pointed upstairs and told me to ask someone up there. Without any directions to a certain desk. No “thank you” or any form of politeness. My time was running out to catch my hotel shuttle so I was in a hurry. Upstairs I only saw the regular AA check in counter where there was a huge lineup. Unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to make the line and I had to leave with much unnecessary luggage. It’s ridiculous to have to pay twice for luggage to get to my final destination. If I could have chosen a faster flight to Managua I would have done it to avoid this. The girls attitude was totally unprofessional. I don’t think AA really care about their customer service. I’ll remember that when I travel for work with my team and pick a différente airline."
"  My 3 children and I were awaiting our last plane home to Phoenix from Los Angeles after visiting South Korea and as we stand to board we see the time of boarding changed from 5:20pm to 10:35pm. When I ask the attendant at the adjacent gate (because their is no attendant at our gate) what is happening she looks it up and says the time was pushed back to 10:35pm. No apologies, no compensation, no regard for the fact that my 83 year old grandmother is stuck waiting at the airport in Phoenix to pick us up. So I'm completely sleep deprived and she is afraid to drive after dark and now I get to drive the hour and a half home from the airport at midnight after traveling over 30 hours without sleep. Their terminals don't even have seats without armrests to stretch out on and try and grab a cat nap. The lack of compassion and customer service from America Airlines is shocking and disappointing to say the least. I will check reviews prior to booking my next flight. Cathy Pacific took excellent care of my family and I from South Korea to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong to LAX., but the customer service went out the window when we transferred into American Airlines hands. I do not recommend anyone fly American Airlines in the future. You're just a ticket number not a customer or consumer to them."
"  My first flight was delayed due to weather. Understandably, it's winter. I expressed my concern that because of the one hour delay I would not be able to make my connection flight and immediately sought out an attendant. The attendant understood, and reserved a backup flight in case the our original second flight took off before we landed. Once we landed we discovered that before we even were taxied to the gate our backup was cancelled and our connecting flight was in the air. On a call to customer relations they couldn't do anything for us until tomorrow. Leaving us in Dallas. We talked back and forth until they said they could set us up on a backup flight to a town 70 miles away from our ending destination. Who knows how this will end up. I've always flown Delta and have never had a problem. Will never use American Airlines again."
"  My husband and I were traveling home the day after thanksgiving flying from Phoenix to Minneapolis. We checked in online, had been through security early and waited at our gate. When we boarded, a gate attendant starting asking my husband a question about our carry on luggage but we could not understand her. She was telling us to go back up the tarmac to measure our bag to make sure it fit. We assured her it did we travel often. Another gate attendant proceeded to take the suitcase out of our hands and tell us we had to check it or we would have to take the next flight. I grabbed ahold of our bag as they started pulling it from me and told them I needed something out of it. They started yelling at us to board the plane. They kept yelling it won’t fit it won’t fit. It was such a bizarre interaction how they started threatening us the plane would leave without us and a flight attendant stood in the door and watched this unfold. Our seats were in row 13 and the entire overhead compartment above our seat was empty. The pilot came up to us and asked if there was a problem and I said yes they took our bags and said it wouldn’t have fit, there is plenty of room right here. He replied “I don’t see any bag.” From telling us we had “5 seconds” to board the plane and that they were going to put us on the next flight when we were still early boarding (and still sat on the plane for 15 minutes before take off) I honestly don’t know what the motive was except to attack us both verbally and physically by pulling my bag from me."
"  My wife and I traveled from Kauai to Sacramento with a connection in Phoenix with American Airlines. The flight crew was late arriving at the airport in Kauai and we were over 30 minutes late departing to Phoenix. We arrived 20 minutes late in Phoenix. Because of the delay, we missed our connection to Sacramento. They closed the door early just as we ran up to the gate. I complained to the American Airlines customer service representative. She told me it was my fault for the missed connection and that I should not have booked the flights so close together. I tried to explain that it was a prepackaged AA flight connection that my travel agent booked. She put us on the next flight 2.5 hours later. That flight was nearly full and we were not able to sit next to each other. Also, I had paid for premium seats that we were not able to sit. The customer service agent also refused to refund the extra I paid for the premium seats. To top things off, the new connection flight was 40 minutes late taking off and arriving in Sacramento. I was surprised at how little American Airlines cared about their customers. Apparently you can pay extra for a seat, get bumped from it, not sit in it, and not get your money back. What a scam!"
  Not happy with the service heading home to Columbus. My girlfriend and I were able to both bring our carry on from Columbus to DC. From DC to Columbus the guy boarding passengers to the plane said we could not take them on and had to pay 50 dollars each since we did not check them in prior. Nor did he allow us to use the bag measure. I want a full refund for checking my bags. I will never travel with American Airlines again. Customer service I would rate an absolute zero.
"  Once again, my American Airlines flight from Birmingham to Dallas was delayed and caused me to miss a full days of work. My flight was scheduled to leave Birmingham at 9:32a I didn't leave until 4:45p. Now on the flight leaving Texas back to Birmingham, here I am still at the airport 3 hours after my scheduled flight. This is a business paid for flight. However I still think it is horrible the things I go through every time I fly American Airlines. They even canceled my return flight back to Birmingham without my knowing. It was taken care of however that was still a potential inconvenience. Today they loaded us on the plane. We sat on the plane for an hour, they tell us something is wrong. We have to walk out of the plane. We get back in they change our gate 3 times. This is always the worst flying experience."
"  One of the worst experience ever with Delta. I have never had to deal with such unfriendly and unprofessional crew in a long haul flight (Sydney to Los Angeles). At lunch time, the flight attendant literally threw the food platter on my tray telling me ""that's pasta and that's what's left"". The rest of the crew set a mood of intimidation, unfriendliness and brashness. Not one smile, not one courteous gesture: plain rude. I was very surprised to witness that such service would still exist nowadays: a real horror story. We even requested to talk to the cabin manager to lodge a complaint but Delta does not even have a crew manager on board (or so were we told as they might back up each other). A truly appalling experience."
"  Our original flight from Heathrow was supposed to be at 9am but was delayed until 6pm, we were told it was due to an electrical storm at JFK through other passengers, Delta never said anything. We had to go through multiple terminals and screenings because of our reassigned flight. We flew to Atlanta and we were told the next flight to Los Angeles was 12 hours later, we even tried other airports and either they had no flights or did not fly there. They messed up our luggage, one made it to Atlanta and the others are still in London. We asked about hotel and meal vouchers through a Delta representative and got none, we were told that they did not do that unless it was Delta's fault because it ""wasn't their fault"" and was claiming it was air traffic control's fault. After being up for 24 hours that was not the answer we wanted to hear. We were compensated at Heathrow by Virgin Atlantic with a more than fair amount for food vouchers just for a little delay. Delta again did not do anything. When we arrived at Atlanta nothing was open and we were hungry. I will never fly Delta again."
  Out of two flights (Oklahoma to San Diego via Dallas) one was so late missed my connection and on the way back it was delayed 3 hours. Seats so narrow I have to sit high and tight. American Airlines is my off the list! 50% failure rate to arrive on time. If you connect in Dallas give yourself 2 hours arrival time to boarding call. AA also charged me 75$ to fly standby on an earlier flight! I am helping them fill seats and they nick me for 75$.
  Panama City (Florida) to Baltimore via Atlanta. Only fly Delta if you don't mind your flight being canceled without prior notification until you arrive at the airport and then your connecting flight being delayed because they waiting on a flight attendant. This is my experience.
"  Paris to Oklahoma City via Dallas DFW with American Airlines. Like other reviews I've read, they have failed to explain that our flight is delayed till far after the departure time which is frustrating. This is my last flight home and it is delayed about 3 hours. My whole trip I've experienced a snappy crew making rude comments to myself and other customers. Very disappointed."
"  Philadelphia to Denver via Atlanta. Never again with Delta. No communication, we were diverted to Tennessee for weather reasons (understandable), then de-boarded and re-boarded - only to have mechanical errors. I have been waiting on the Delta staff to tell me what's going on for hours and their customer service line has a 2 hour wait. This is ridiculous. I will never fly them again. Uncommunicative and unprofessional. No voucher offers for food or water ($4/ small bottle at the airport)."
"  Philadelphia to Orlando return and will never fly American Airlines again. A horrendous experience! My family and I were taking our first family vacation in 20 years, as there are 9 of us, we booked our flight almost a year in advance to ensure that we would sit together, especially since my 2 year old niece would be coming as well and it was her first time flying. About a month before our trip we were told that all of our seats were changed and none of us could sit together. They had my 2 year old niece sitting in a seat alone. When we called to sort this out we encountered nothing but pure rudeness and constant transfers. After 4 hours (no exaggeration) on the phone trying to just change one seat so my niece wasn't alone, we were told there was nothing we could do and would have to try and change our seat at the airport, mere hours before we were supposed to take off and that nothing was guaranteed. We started out in Philly, flying to Orlando. The entire staff was rude, yelling at passengers as we tried to board the plane telling us that we had to check our carry on bags because there was no space left on the plane. After all the chaos, she was able to sit with her daughter and a nice man switched seats with her husband, so my niece was able to fly with both her parents by her side. Once we got on board there was plenty of room for additional carry ons, some overhead compartments were completely empty. We had a wonderful vacation and then on the flight back home we had the same issue. My entire family was spread throughout the plane and once again my 2 year old niece was booked in a seat alone. The staff on the flight coming home were much nicer and much more accommodating but it wasn't confirmed that my sister would be able to sit with her daughter until literally 1 minute before we boarded. As we were attempting to switch her seats we met several other families that had the same issues as we did. Countless children 7 and younger were seated alone and apart from their families. And AA didn't extend an apology nor an explanation as to why they needed to separate everyone. I will never fly this airline again. I'd much rather give my hard earned money to an airline that would accommodate my family and I. What a terrible experience."
"  Pocatello to Charlotte via Portland / Salt Lake City / Atlanta with Delta. I spoke to the customer service agent in Pocatello about a delay notification received. At that point, I wanted to cancel and fly a different airline out of neighboring Salt Lake City. They looked for additional flights, there were no other options were found. Delta agent assured me it would not interfere with original arrival time. I accepted this but after my first flight, my third flight was delayed. I believe it was known originally and they just didn't want to refund my money and have me fly a different airline. Now I am currently stuck in Atlanta waiting on the next flight to Charlotte at noon. This will be my fourth flight. I explained it was my daughters birthday party, which I will not make it to now. I have been at various airports for 24 hrs. I just wanted to cancel and was deterred, lied to and I will not be flying Delta anytime soon. I suggest you choose another airline."
"  Portland to Fresno via Los Angeles with American Airlines. I have traveled all over the world on numerous airlines, some cheap, some expensive. AA is the worst hands down in every aspect. Budget airlines in Asia are more competent. This is the last time I will put up with AA's incompetence and terrible customer service. On this trip every single flight has been delayed at the last minute, causing missed connections and an excess of running around the airport from one gate to another while they attempt to get us to where we are going. On board the flights their staff are civil at best and all out rude most of the time, and from my experience this applies to their customer representatives within the airports as well."
"  Providence to Raleigh/Durham via Detroit and Atlanta. For many years I have flown with Delta Air Lines nationally and internationally. Most of the time I was very pleased and complemented their kindness and great service. However, my last experience was totally the contrary. Both flights were delayed. I missed my connection and 90% of the agents I had to speak with were practically rude and had no desire to help. After going from one customer service station to another, I found a very kind agent who took her time and found me a seat in the next available flight. No apologies, no willingness to solve the problem was the attitude of the other ones."
"  Raleigh–Durham to Brussels via New York JFK with Delta. I had an great experience, particularly on the JFK to Brussels flight. The cabin staff, and especially the staff who served my meals, provided excellent care and was very attentive. It made my whole flight very enjoyable. I will definitely fly Delta again."
"  Raleigh-Durham to New York LaGuardia with Delta. I had a flight set up for the 12th and was forced to rebook to the 13th due to severe weather. My flight was scheduled to depart at 7am. I got confirmation just the night before, and had confirmation via email as well. I set my rides around this schedule, got up at 4am and headed to the airport. While in route, nearly arriving at the airport, my boarding pass changed to a 7pm flight. I received no email, no phone call and no text. I called to have this corrected and the representative lied to me and told me that the 7am flight was cancelled so they moved me to the 7pm flight without any form of update. Upon checking with Delta, I found that the 7am flight was still on time to depart. I state again that I had already nearly arrived at the airport by the time I got the notice of the 12 hour change. I have never been so disappointed in my life, I was able to have it changed to a 12pm flight, however this should not have been the case. Someone made a very big mistake along the way and I paid the price, not only did I pay the price but no one took accountability for this. Needless to say my frequent flyer miles are now wasted as I will never again fly Delta, nor will I recommend Delta to anyone."
  Reno to St Louis via Dallas. Because of strong wind gusts in Reno our flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight in Dallas. The agent at the front desk kept us all informed with calmness and good nature. A second desk was opened and we were rebooked the next day for a flight out of Dallas the next day. All American employees were effective and helpful in this situation. As huge as it is the company has its eye on the customers. Good job.
"  Roanoke to Cancun via Atlanta with Delta. Been stuck in Atlanta since 5pm yesterday and to top it off was stuck in Roanoke from 7am till almost 4pm the same day. No fuel for the plane for the 7am flight which made us miss getting to ATL. Put on a flight that finally got cancelled due to no co pilot, then spent 6.5 hours waiting to speak to someone in line at the service desk to get a flight which now at 12:23pm is delayed because once again no flight crew. Delta has cost me 2 days of vacation time at work and I have lost almost 2 days of time at the resort that's paid for on advance and not refundable. No one from Delta cares and keeps blaming the weather, however Delta didn't have fuel for my first plane and have now twice have had no crew for a plane that is ready. They don't even care I slept in a terminal because there were no hotel rooms available. I doubt I will ever fly Delta again because no one seems to care about how they have inconvenienced me and my wife - other airlines made the trip out of here why can't they?"
"  San Diego to Providence via Atlanta with Delta. We were traveling as a family to attend our son's graduation. We booked our trip in First Class as we consider coast to coast a long haul flight, and we like our comfort. Firstly, 4/4 flights were delayed. Delays due to weather, to not having a gate ready to disembark passengers, to long lines waiting to take off, to a faulty fuel cap, to missing paperwork, to delayed arrival of connecting aircraft, etc. Second, the seats in first class are hard as rocks, as well as cramped and narrow with insufficient recline. United gets the edge on this amenity, hands down. On the 4 aircraft we flew on, only two had entertainment systems. Only one of those two worked. On the other two aircraft, you may use your own device to access their new ""Delta Studio"", which offers ""free"" entertainment. However, the only entertainment value in Delta Studio is trying, and consistently failing, to get it to function. The icing on the cake of our tedious journey was on the final leg home. Our flight from Providence to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours, then rerouted off the Eastern Seaboard to a far western track south, causing more delay, bringing us in to Atlanta about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure of our last leg home. At the arriving gate, someone told us that if we sprinted, we just might make our flight, which at that point was listed as on time. We actually managed to get to our departure gate at about 10:30, which was scheduled departure. The genesis of the problems we encountered from here on began when we optimistically assumed that the gate agent at our delayed arrival gate had notified the departing gate that their 3 missing passengers were on their way. Alas, he did not. Gate agent at departing gate tells us that he reassigned 1 of our 3 first class seats to someone else, since we ""failed"" to make our flight, and that the only option left was a standby seat left in the middle seat of economy. So, my husband's seat was reassigned during our sprint to the gate and he gets downgraded. We asked if we would receive compensation for the downgrade. We asked if at least my husband could expect premium service in his new seat assignment. We asked if we could be rebooked on the next flight. Staff replies with chapter/verse about ""procedures"". My husband crams in to his middle economy seat, my son and I up in First, when a few minutes later, captain says flight was delayed due to fuel and paperwork."
"  San Francisco to Ft Lauderdale via Atlanta. We have never flown Delta before, but decided to try them because they are an Alaska Airlines partner. Check in at SFO went well. The First Class cabin flight attendant was surly and not what I've experienced on other airlines in First Class. She was rude and unhelpful. Also on a flight over two hours they're supposed to serve you a meal - they never served us a meal. On our return flight I read that in First you have two free checked bags and the third bag is $25. I'm still looking on their site as they were trying to charge me $150. The website is poorly done and very confusing. I went to Delta checked bags under Delta Airlines and I'm still trying to find it. The customer service was rude and unhelpful when I asked for a supervisor to come and assist. When I explained that his website was not very good at telling me what the baggage fee was he walked away.  We were on a full fare First Class ticket and I have never encountered more rude people than I did on these two flights. We will fly United to Florida on our next trip and it would take a lot for us to ever consider using Delta again."
"  San Francisco to Montevideo via Miami on Nov. 7, and return on Nov. 15-16. All flights were on time. Both flights between SFO and MIA (# 931 and 967) were on a new-looking A321 with great AVOD and with smiley cabin crews that were constantly around and eager to help. There were two rounds of drinks and a cookie on these 6-hour flights; the optional food for sale was tasty but expensive. The flights between MIA and MVD (# 989 and 984) were on an old-looking B763 with archaic video screens on the ceiling, small overhead bins, and a mostly friendly and efficient cabin crew, though 1 or 2 of them looked like they didn’t want to be there (on # 984 they didn’t even distribute headphones for the movie or audio service unless passengers requested them) and a male attendant consistently skipped passengers during drink rounds and never acknowledged a “thank you”. The other attendants tried to make up for these slackers. On these 9-hour flights, a small but edible dinner was served 1 hour after departure, followed by a minimal breakfast 1 hour before landing. I suggest bringing a small blanket (all flights were very cold) and a thin pillow (seat padding wasn’t great). Desk and gate agents were friendly and moved things along quickly. Overall, across the four legs of the trip, I had a good experience for a very affordable price, much better than I was expecting from reading many reviews here. I would recommend and fly AA again, trying to avoid their B763 planes. As a side note: I was expecting a more meaningful “preferred boarding” experience for having an AA-associated credit card. On the MIA-SFO flight, by the time I reached my row 9 seat, all overhead space was taken all the way through row 14, so I had to become the dreaded passenger who needs to move down the aisle against the flow of traffic during boarding and deplaning."
"  Santo Domingo to New York. January 1st, 2018. We’ve been stuck at the airport in Santo Domingo since 1:30 only to find out our flight is pushed to 10 am next day. American Airline knew way before 1:30pm that they did not have enough crew to fly but didn’t bother telling customers until 7pm. They knew that crew that was flying in will not fly back because they had to take mandatory break. Do they have any regard for their customers?‬ Nothing stopping them from charging $1,200 for economy tickets and $25 for the first checked bag on a top of that. But they feel that it's perfectly fine not to inform their passengers about the flight that won't be flying any time soon. Were they too afraid to lose some money from that ridiculas fare? This is a complete ignorance or incompetence. The way they put it ""a mistake the company made"". A mistake they said they’ve fixed already. There was a news article by major news outlet 2-3 weeks ago that American Airline granted too much PTO time to their pilots and crews for the holiday season and major service outages are expected. AA responded that issue is resolved and no delays or cancellations are expected. I guess it was just a PR spin."
"  Seattle to Hong Kong with Delta. A very nice flight. Ground staff helped me to check in as the self-service kiosk couldn't cope with me taking a one-way flight, so got checked in super quick. Adequate and reasonable food. Plenty of alcohol. The FA just said started pouring the wine and said, 'You tell me when to stop'. Frequent offers of water throughout the flight. Plenty of movies to watch on the IFE. Good earphones. Polite FA's on the whole. Amenities kit provided. Flight left on time. No complaints at all."
"  Tampa to Denver via Dallas DFW with American Airlines. Flight was delayed 1 hour 20 minutes. Missed a shuttle to the ski resort. Upon arrival waited 1 hour 10 minutes for baggage to arrive at carousel. Missed another shuttle. While waiting, went to AA baggage claim office to inquire about thhe delay and was told by the attending AA representative that: ""I should go complain online because cause it ain't my fault"" Just another example of the great service you get for being loyal to an airline and achieving status. AA has been just terrible the last year."
"  Terrible customer service. Delta allows you to book a flight for a certain day and time and will then change your itinerary by 6hours weeks to months later, with no remediation if their new flight plan for you doesn't work with all the travel plans you've made. Secondly, they routinely check all rollerboards for zone 3 passengers no matter that there are always plenty of overhead spaces. They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to. In summary, hate that airlines take advantage of customers. Unfortunately, Delta isn't the only one that does this."
  Terrible first class. No seat infotainment screen. There is only a small ~9” screen 2 seats in front of me. Totally poor for first class in 2017. Food was mediocre at best. Overhead bins are smaller than average. I won’t be flying American again if I can help it.
"  The absolute worst experience I've ever had on an airline. I've flown Delta or United my entire life but flying from Dallas to Atlanta, American seemed like the way to go. Wrong. My flight was delayed, the flight crew was unorganized and upon landing in Atlanta they somehow managed to take us to a gate that had a broken jetway. We then had to get towed to another gate after 30-45 minutes of waiting. Very unorganized and not efficient in allowing passengers to make their connections."
"  The aircraft appeared new, at least on the inside and was very clean. The flight was on time. We were given a pad to spread over the seat for sleeping along with the customary blanket and pillow. The seating is in the 1-2-1 configuration with the same controls and hardware that our Cathay Pacific flight had on the first leg of this trip (Los Angeles - Hong Kong), my wife and I had the two center seats. The business section began with row 4. We had access to Cathay Pacific's Bridge Lounge prior to the flight which was comfortable. It was a night flight (leaving at 7.40pm) so we were served dinner soon after lift-off. The meal was average, with a first course that was inedible (grilled cheese served ice cold and so dry it was difficult to cut or chew). I didn't see anyone eat that course-I wonder if AA gets any feedback on food selections that don't get eaten? The second course, scallops for us, was good enough to eat although nothing to look forward to. The flight crew was spotty in that some were attentive and efficient (in my wife's row) and some were harried, inefficient, and surly (my row). On the whole, the crew was nowhere as good and nice as those in the other airlines we flew this trip, which were all Asian airlines so perhaps it's not a fair comparison. Unfortunately, we had flown Cathay Pacific on the flight over to Asia which is a tough airline to compare to in regards to service although frankly any Asian airline we have flown has better flight crews (more service oriented and nicer) than American Airlines' crews. The Captain was informative as we waited to take off, which was nice. The entertainment options didn't include any recent quality movies although some quality older movies were offered (like ""Casablanca""). The crew didn't bother to ask passengers to open windows when we landed in LAX which made landing a bit less comfortable. All in all we were happily surprised with the seats and aircraft but suffered through the kind of service that is characteristic of AA in our experience. This plane did offer wifi although business passengers had to pay for it ($12 for 2 hours was the shortest plan). It took so long to pull up the wifi plan options I figured the service would be to slow and didn't buy it. Apparently AA sees wifi as an additional revenue opportunity rather than a way to enhance business class and make it more competitive with other airlines. We had flown AA on a similar flight returning from Asia a few years ago and it seemed to us that AA is trying to improve their business class and it is better than it was then. Unfortunately for AA in that market the Asia carriers are often as good as it gets in terms of flight crew service which continues to be AA's weak suit."
"  The airplane on this route for a 9 hours flight lacked personal inflight entertainment and only had “shared” TV. It also lacked USB ports for charging phones. Only a few seats had chargers but they required an AC adptor like the ones that are inserted in a car cigarette lighter. The airline advertised free WiFi with online entertainment available on personal phones, but it didn’t work. The inability to charge phones would have also diminished its value regardless. The rows of seats were not evenly spaced. Ours was particularly narrow making it difficult to even place or remove the carry on luggage under the seat. It was a very boring, uncomfortable flight. I usually don’t fly this Airline due to its poor reputation. I purchased the ticket with British Airways not realizing the flight was operated by American Airlines. I had also requested a special meal which wasn’t honored. I was hoping they would prove my perception of them wrong, but they did not. On a positive note, the on board personnel was pleasant and helpful."
"  This was easily the worst flight I've ever been on and it all comes down to the staff. To begin with, I was in a front row, exit row window seat in their 'economy plus' area. Being in an exit row you typically have to attest that you can step up to the plate if there's an emergency and be capable of doing so. The center seat in my row ended up with an extremely morbidly obese woman who was so large she was literally covering part of my body with her own. Her armpit was resting on my shoulder. The staff did not do anything about this situation. This is first and foremost a safety violation, secondly, I did not pay to be the armrest for another human being. This is unacceptable and the airline should have moved her, myself or made other arrangements for someone so large. When the flight attendant came around with dinner, I politely refused. She stood there, literally staring at me, and barked 'How'd I know you'd say that'? Well, I don't know ma'am - do you normally eat when a strangers armpit is grazing your cheek? Perhaps that's why I declined. When we were getting set to land at LHR we were put into a holding pattern. No biggie, this happens some times. However there was no communication from the captain or crew about how long this would be. Approximately a half hour into this wait I asked the flight attendant if she had any idea how long it would be. She stood in front of me, silently removed her scarf, adjusted it, retied it and then rolled her eyes at me and said ""Honey, this happens to every flight, every day at this airport"" - um, excuse me, it doesn't. I've flown into LHR 8 times in the last 10 months on British Airways and not once have we gone into a holding pattern. Not. Once. At any rate, as that didn't answer my question, I repeated my question. She said ""do you have a layover?"" I told her yes, but that it was a 2.5 hour layover so I wasn't concerned about that so much. I didn't want to scream that I was desperate to get out from under the armpit of the person next to me. She literally walked away saying we'd land soon enough. Not to mention, she left a garbage bag at the bulkhead that was kicked over frequently by people lining up for the toilet. She never once picked up the contents - I did - because I didn't want coffee/juice/whatever was in there staining my suede shoes. I literally purchased the in-fight wifi so I could write them a complaint in real-time. I've never been so fuming at an airline in my life! I'll give their wifi 2 stars since my email was successfully sent while still being squashed and poorly treated mid flight. I will never, ever fly American Airlines again! "
"  This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. They changed my flight without notice, turning a 12 hour day into a 22 hour day of flying and sitting in airports. I could have forgiven that had their employees had one ounce of sympathy. Their cold uncaring response is what makes Delta the worst airline. One of them stated, well we have to talk to a lot of people, when I pointed out their awful customer service."
  Time and time again I have problems with American Airlines. This time my flights from Columbus to Montreal via Charlotte was delayed causing me to miss my connection flight and the only thing they can do is to rebook me the next day and add a second connection. I flew with them back in December 2016 and I once again missed my connection flight due to mechanical problems that delayed us 2h. Never has American compensated me. They don't offer to rebook on another company either. They offer the best flight hours in my case but don't respect them. I have never been on time when flying with them.
"  Treated my family to a First Class flight to visit family in Texas. Flying American from Islip to Dallas Fort Worth via Philadelphia. First leg fine (Islip to Philadelphia), except for a really snarly, older flight attendant that acted like we were all cutting into her 'me' time. Just informed by the ticket agents at Philly that our 8:25 pm flight is delayed until 12:25 pm because they gave our crew to another delayed flight. Chaos ensued. Who wants to be in an airport all night? Well apparently the ticket agents missed the kindergarten a.m. vs. p.m. lesson. Still stuck here for another three hours and now my family has to pick us up at 4 am. People complaining, but ticket agents just giving everyone the 'who gives a damn' look. Do yourself a big favor and pass up this airline and its unhappy crew and staff!"
  Very poor on time performance. I have been traveling back and forth from Philadelphia to Boston for last four weeks with American i.e. 8 times. I had my tickets booked in advance and every single time I faced at least a 45 minutes delay. They never leave the gate on time. They should seriously consider keeping upto their times and schedules. It makes people who travel wiTh American looks like fools. Almost all my flights departed well after the arrival time at my destination. No value for money.
"  Victoria-Seattle-Atlanta-Washington (DCA), Delta Comfort+ class, outbound on 2 August 2017, returning 10 August, using points accumulated with KLM plus $400 in taxes and fees. In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics – Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T on the ATL-SEA return leg. The FA had no idea how the drink should be poured, even though I'd done my best to ask her to (i) give me a cup with a couple of ice cubes, then (ii) give me the little bottle of gin (they offered Bombay Sapphire), and then (iii) let me pour the tonic water as the last step. She kept giving me a combination of ice and tonic water first, for me to add the gin as the last step. My Grandma would be horrified."
"  Was very disappointed in first class service on an international route from Santa Ana to Rome via Dallas. First flight, SNA-DFW boarded aircraft and no one offered to hang my coat. Had to locate the closet and do it myself. Was seated 75m before offered a drink, and then 5m later before I'd even taken a sip my food was brought. I asked her to put it back into the oven until the happy hour was over. Flight from DFW - FCO also problematic. Had to ask two different staff how to put down the table. I had pre-ordered the duck and it was really awful, like what I'd imagine they'd serve in prison. Not a first class experience at all (I remember flying JFK - LHR on Pan Am and they carved meat for the meal right from the cart). An hour before the flight landed, I was asked to return my headphones so had no inflight entertainment last hour of flight. Why can they not do their housekeeping duties after all the passengers have left? They seem to have a checklist of duties to perform and they just want to rush through with no care for the inflight experience of the passengers. Quite a different attitude than from AF, KL, LH, OS, LX, or BA (even though BA is racing to the bottom to meet the service standards of Easy Jet and Ryan Air -- they charge £3 for a car of coca cola and there are no meals on board anymore). I returned on AA in Economy and had a better in-flight experience (the meal was good). Very disappointed and First Class costs $3,600 one-way I note."
"  Washington DC to Minneapolis. Flight cancelled due to de-icing. Poor planning by AA. Sun Country Airlines made it out in time from same airport to same destination (Minneapolis). AA was only able to rebook for next day without reimbursement for hotel or food. The rebooked flight was a one stop flight with a 5 hour layover. Original flight was non-stop. At a later flight with the stop, AA had maintenance problems and changed gate at the last minute. Seriously considering canceling my miles card with them and will definitely chose another airline next time I fly for business!"
  We flew with American Airlines from Hartford to Orange County via Dallas. My wife and I had to use the customer services of wheelchair. We found the staff helpful and accommodating. We felt we were taken care off. Staff of AA were courteous on our journey. Will fly AA again.
"  We were to fly out of Omaha to Los Cabos via Atlanta with Delta. We got to airport at 3:30 a.m. only to find out our flight said it was delayed until 10:00 a.m. Called 1-800 number right away, was on hold for 25 minutes. We asked if they could rebook us on another flight that morning. After looking things over our flight was actually showing decommissioned and no other flights scheduled to replace. They tried to see if any other flights available and then asked if anyone was at the Delta counter and told me to talk to them. I hung up and went to Delta counter and basically they couldn't explain to me why this happened but stated they could see if there were any other fights available. They kept asking me if there were still 4 of us flying, I said yes this is our family vacation so all 4 of us were going to Mexico. There were no flights available but they could possibly get 3 of us out that day and the other person out the next day. I told her that would not work, so the only other other option was to leave the next day. I politely said I knew this wasn't their fault but wanted to know why Delta would cancel the flight without making other accommodations for the passengers whose flight schedules were now messed up. I was handed a Delta card with the 1-800 number and told me to call them. I indicated I already did. This was a huge ordeal as I felt Delta was of no help for something they created. Long story short, in order to fly out that day I had to purchase additional tickets with American Airlines. I went back to the Delta counter spoke and said I was able to get tickets with American and wanted to cancel the ones just booked. She said that was fine but that would also cancel our return flight. I indicated that was unfair as the flight going to was the only one affected, but was told this wasn't how it worked. I had to call the 800 # with my travel agent and tell the story again to find out if I purchased the tickets with American if I could keep my return tickets with Delta. She said yes I should since this was Delta's fault, she told me to go to the Delta counter and let them know. I told her they were not helpful and basically told me no. She placed me on hold came back and stated she got a hold of Delta and all was confirmed, return flight was still valid and cancelled only tickets going out. My travel agent is trying to get those tickets refunded from Delta since I basically had to pay twice for tickets to Mexico. Ridiculous - shame on Delta."
"  What can I say about American Airlines, well it's the worst airline I have flown with. I was meant to be flying from Las Vegas to Auckland via Los Angeles on 23 June 2017. It's now 26 June 2017 and I have only just got home. The first flight was delayed so I missed my connecting flight, and ended up being scheduled for the next flight 24 hours later. Found it difficult getting any help at LAX airport from AA, some staff told me to sleep on the floor, eventually I was put in a hotel for 2 nights but as I got there and gave my credit card we were promptly kicked out as the hotel was overbooked and they said American Airlines was coming to get us to take us to another hotel (there was 11 travellers in total) they never came. Had to make own way back to the airport. It was hot temperatures, and no one would provide us with bottled water. It took me an hour to get a $12 dinner voucher as I felt the $12 I got given wasnt good enough since $5 for a bottle of water at LAX. Got into Auckland airport eventually, no American Airlines staff anywhere to help. Went to baggage servies and they managed to get a staff member to talk to me. I feel like I have been treated poorly and I haven't been apologised to."
  Wonderful customer service. The customer service staff who serviced flight Delta 2414 from Las Vegas to Seattle on 22 June 2017 was amazing. This gentleman was polite and professional and was absolutely funny. I was also amazed that the pilot who was standing at the counter also spoke and joked with customers waiting for seat allocation. This is very refreshing and cool. The special treatment continued on the flight with very friendly flight attendants. The snacks provided on this domestic flight is better than what you get on a premium airline in Australia. I am very impressed with the service from all levels. Keep up the good work Delta. My family and I will definitely fly with Delta again.
  Worst airline ever. Canceled my connecting flight on the way down and now next one is delayed. Also told me that my bag that I fly with every week and had their airline gate ticket on was too big. Then charged me. Then after going out of security to check the bag and coming back to TSA checkpoint my ticket timed out and was invalid.
"  Worst experience to date with an airline. Sat on the tarmack because of a scheduling issue. An hour after landing, we are still sitting here because another flight is at our gate. After 2 connecting flights the last thing I want to do is sit here and listen to the captain come up with excuses. I will never fly Delta again."
"  You know it's bad when American Airlines staff are complaining about how bad their employer is. I went to Greece 3 weeks ago and now coming back through Philadelphia to Los Angeles with the same issues - nothing but delays. First going the flight was delayed by 3 hours and we ultimately missed our connecting flight when I had to spend the night in Philadelphia. Now, I'm coming back to the states and right when we left the dock, the plane had to be called back because there are 15 passengers and 25 bags that needed to be picked up. Why is this airline always late or unorganized? Terrible. You couldn't pay me to fly with American Airlines again."
